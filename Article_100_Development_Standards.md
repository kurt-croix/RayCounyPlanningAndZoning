# Article 100 - Development Standards

## 100.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading

### A. Applicability

#### 1. New Development
The off-street parking and loading standards of this Article apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established.

#### 2. Expansions and Alterations
The off-street parking and loading standards of this Article apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing & expansion) must equal at least 75 percent of minimum ratio established in Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" of this Article.

#### 3. Timing of Installation
Required parking spaces and drives shall be ready for use and approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to allow issuance of a certificate of occupancy before installation of required parking if the applicant provides a letter of credit, performance bond, escrow deposit or other acceptable financial security adequate to ensure that all required parking will be installed when weather conditions permit. The amount of the financial guarantee must be equal to at least 100 percent of the estimated total cost (labor and materials). The county shall be authorized to use such financial guarantee to complete the work if the required parking is not in place by the date stated on the approved performance guarantee.

#### 4. No Reduction Below Minimums
Existing parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this Article. Any change in use that increases applicable off-street parking or loading requirements will be deemed a violation of these Zoning Regulations unless parking and loading spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

#### 3. Off-Street Parking Schedule "C"
Schedule "C" uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard.

**a. Parking Study**
Anyone proposing to develop or expand a use requiring Schedule "C" parking must submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.

**b. Review by Planning and Zoning Administrator**
The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. After reviewing the parking study, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use.

**c. Appeals**
Appeals of the Planning and Zoning Administrator's decision may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.14.

### C. Rules for Computing Requirements
The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements.

#### 1. Multiple Uses
Lots containing more than 1 use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.

#### 2. Fractions
When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of ½ or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than ½ will be rounded up to the next higher whole number.

#### 3. Area Measurements
Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area, which for purposes of computing off-street parking requirements, shall mean the gross floor area of the building measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings and shall include the following areas:
a. the area of each floor of the structure and
b. all attic space having headroom of 7 feet-10 inches or more

#### 4. Occupancy-Based Standards
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.

#### 5. Unlisted Uses
Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with Off-Street Parking Schedule "C."

### D. Location of Required Parking

#### 1. On-Site Parking; Setbacks and Buffering
Except as expressly stated in this Article, all required off-street parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use. Unless otherwise expressly stated, off-street parking areas shall be set back at least 10 feet from all front (street right-of-way) and rear property lines.

**a. Street Buffers**
Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent street rights-of-way by principal buildings or by landscape buffer strips as follows:

| Parking Area Size (Number of Spaces) | Buffer Width Minimum (feet) | Minimum Planting Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| 5-15 | 5 | Hedgerow (shrubs planted maximum of 3 feet on center) |
| 16-50 | 10 | 1 small tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet |
| 51+ | 20 | 1 medium tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet |

*Minimum sizes: shrubs = 1 gallon, small deciduous tree = 1½-inch DBH, small evergreen tree = 4½-foot height, medium deciduous tree = 2½-inch DBH, medium evergreen tree = 5½ feet height (DBH=Diameter at Breast Height)*

The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit the use of existing (pre-development) vegetation as a substitute for landscape buffer strips if such existing vegetation will provide a visual buffer.

**b. Residential Buffers**
Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent residential zoning districts by buildings, fences, walls or dense landscape planting screens with a minimum height of 5 feet. Preservation of existing (pre-development) vegetation is the preferred method of screening.

#### 2. Off-Site Parking
Off-street parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if approved in accordance with Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the off-site parking complies with all of following standards.

**a. Ineligible Activities**
Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located off-site.

**b. Location**
No off-site parking space may be located more than 1,000 feet from the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use that it serves by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area.

**c. Zoning Classification**
Off-site parking areas serving uses located in non-residential zoning districts must be located in non-residential zoning districts. Off-site parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or non-residential zoning districts.

In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement will be required. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning and Zoning Department. Recordation of the agreement with the Recorder of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this Article.

#### 3. Shared Parking
Developments or uses with different operating hours or peak business periods may share off-street parking spaces if approved in accordance with the Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the shared parking complies with all of following standards.

**a. Location**
Shared parking spaces must be located within 1000 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.
