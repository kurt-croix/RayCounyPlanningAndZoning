# Article 100 - Development Standards

## 100.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading

### A. Applicability

#### 1. New Development
The off-street parking and loading standards of this Article apply to any new [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) constructed and to any new [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) established.

#### 2. Expansions and Alterations
The off-street parking and loading standards of this Article apply when an existing [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) or [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) or [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use), provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) (preexisting & expansion) must equal at least 75 percent of minimum ratio established in Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" of this Article.

#### 3. Timing of Installation
Required [parking spaces](./Article_150_Definitions.md#parking-space) and drives shall be ready for use and approved by the [Planning and Zoning Administrator](./Article_150_Definitions.md#planning-and-zoning-administrator) prior to issuance of a [certificate of occupancy](./Article_150_Definitions.md#certificate-of-occupancy). The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to allow issuance of a certificate of occupancy before installation of required parking if the applicant provides a letter of credit, performance bond, escrow deposit or other acceptable financial security adequate to ensure that all required parking will be installed when weather conditions permit. The amount of the financial guarantee must be equal to at least 100 percent of the estimated total cost (labor and materials). The county shall be authorized to use such financial guarantee to complete the work if the required parking is not in place by the date stated on the approved performance guarantee.

#### 4. No Reduction Below Minimums
Existing parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this Article. Any change in [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) that increases applicable off-street [parking](./Article_150_Definitions.md#parking-space) or loading requirements will be deemed a violation of these Zoning Regulations unless parking and loading spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
