# Article 130 - Nonconformities

## 130.1 General

The purpose of this Article is to establish regulations for the continuation, alteration, and termination of [nonconforming uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use), [structures](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure), and [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) that were legally established before the effective date of these Zoning Regulations but do not comply with current requirements.

### A. Intent
It is the intent of these regulations to:
1. Permit the continued use of nonconforming situations
2. Encourage the eventual elimination of nonconformities
3. Prevent the expansion of nonconforming situations
4. Establish clear standards for alterations to nonconforming situations

### B. General Standards
1. No [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use), [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure), or [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) shall be enlarged, extended, or altered except in compliance with these regulations
2. Nonconformities shall not be deemed to authorize violations of other applicable codes and regulations
3. The burden of proof that a nonconformity is legal shall be on the property owner

## 130.2 Nonconforming Uses

### A. Continuation
A [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use) may be continued, but shall not be:
1. Enlarged or expanded
2. Extended to occupy additional [floor area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#floor-area) or land area
3. Moved to another portion of the same [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) or parcel
4. Changed to another [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use)

### B. Discontinuance and Abandonment
1. If a [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use) is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, the [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) shall be deemed abandoned and shall not be reestablished
2. Intent to resume a discontinued [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) shall not confer the right to do so
3. Normal maintenance and repairs during periods of discontinuance shall not be considered evidence of intent to resume the [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use)

### C. Change to Conforming Use
A [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use) may be changed to a conforming [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use), but once changed to a conforming [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use), it shall not revert to a [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use).

### D. Restoration After Damage
If a [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) containing a [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use) is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty:
1. The [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) may be restored and the [nonconforming use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#nonconforming-use) resumed if restoration begins within 12 months and is completed within 24 months of the damage
2. If the cost of restoration exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of the [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure), the [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) must conform to current regulations

## 130.3 Nonconforming Structures

### A. Continuation
Nonconforming [structures](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) may be continued and maintained, but shall not be:
1. Enlarged or expanded in any manner that increases the nonconformity
2. Moved to another location on the same [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) unless the new location conforms to current requirements
3. Structurally altered unless the alteration reduces the nonconformity

### B. Normal Maintenance and Repairs
Normal maintenance and repairs necessary to keep a nonconforming [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) in good condition are permitted, provided that the nonconformity is not increased.

### C. Restoration After Damage
1. A nonconforming [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) that is damaged or destroyed may be restored to its previous condition if:
   a. Restoration begins within 12 months of the damage
   b. Restoration is completed within 24 months of the damage
   c. The damage was not the result of willful or negligent acts

2. If restoration is not completed within the specified time period, any subsequent use of the property must conform to current regulations

### D. Improvements
Improvements to nonconforming [structures](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) are permitted if:
1. The improvements do not increase the nonconformity
2. The improvements bring the [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) closer to compliance with current regulations
3. The total value of improvements does not exceed 50% of the assessed value of the [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure)

## 130.4 Nonconforming Lots

### A. Use of Nonconforming Lots
A nonconforming [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) of record that was legally created before the effective date of these regulations may be used for any [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) permitted in the [zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district), subject to compliance with all other applicable regulations.

### B. Building on Nonconforming Lots
[Buildings](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) may be constructed on nonconforming [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot), provided that:
1. The [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) was legally created and of record before the effective date of these regulations
2. The [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) complies with all applicable [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback), height, and other requirements to the greatest extent possible
3. [Variances](./Article_150_Definitions.md#variance) may be required for dimensional standards that cannot be met

### C. Combination of Lots
1. Nonconforming [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) under the same ownership that are contiguous may be required to be combined if the combination would create a [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) that more closely conforms to current requirements
2. Once combined, the [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) may not be subdivided in a manner that creates new nonconforming [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot)

## 130.5 Nonconforming Signs

### A. Continuation
Nonconforming [signs](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) that were legally erected before the effective date of these regulations may be continued, but shall not be:
1. Enlarged or expanded
2. Relocated
3. Structurally altered except to reduce the nonconformity

### B. Normal Maintenance
Normal maintenance and repairs to keep nonconforming [signs](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) in good condition are permitted, provided that the [sign](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) copy may be changed.

### C. Replacement
Nonconforming [signs](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) may be replaced with conforming [signs](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) at any time. Once replaced with a conforming [sign](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign), the [sign](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) may not revert to a nonconforming condition.

### D. Abandonment
If a nonconforming [sign](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) is not used to display a message for a continuous period of 6 months, it shall be deemed abandoned and must be removed or brought into compliance with current regulations.

### E. Amortization
The [County Commission](./Article_150_Definitions.md#county-commission) may establish amortization schedules for the removal of nonconforming [signs](./Article_150_Definitions.md#sign) that pose safety hazards or significantly impact community character.
