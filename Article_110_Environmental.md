## 110.1 Dams and Water Impoundment Structures

### A. General

Dams and water [impoundment structures](./Article_150_Definitions.md#impoundment-structure) shall be planned, designed and constructed under the supervision of a structural or professional [engineer](./Article_150_Definitions.md#engineer) registered in the [State of Missouri](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/Home.aspx) and shall comply with all applicable county and state standards. A preliminary engineering report, including soil investigations and design procedures, in accordance with state and county standards, may be submitted to the county prior to any development approval. The applicant's engineer shall certify that the dam is constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. (See [Article 80.13](./Article_80_Subdivision_Design_Improvements.md#8013-dams-and-water-impoundment-structures))

### B. Dams

A dam construction permit must be obtained from the [Building Official](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building-official) before beginning [construction](./Article_150_Definitions.md#construction) of any dam. A dam construction permit shall only be granted as follows:

**1. Small Parcel Dams (Less than 20 acres)**
Dams that are proposed to be constructed on [parcels](./Article_150_Definitions.md#parcel) of less than 20 acres in area shall be designed by a [professional engineer](./Article_150_Definitions.md#professional-engineer) registered in the [State of Missouri](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/Home.aspx). Prior to construction of such dam, detailed design plans shall be submitted for review by the [Building Official](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building-official) for compliance with all applicable county and state standards. After the construction of such dam, the engineer shall certify that the dam is built in accordance with the approved plans.

**2. Plan Requirements**
Submitted plans must show the method of dam construction, the materials to be used for fill, including the specified soil types, all proposed structures for the control of excess water, and the maximum land area that the impounded water could cover. The plan shall note the number of acres contained in the drainage area topographically higher than the lowest point of the dam.

**3. Large Drainage Area Dams (20+ acres)**
Dams that impound water from a [drainage area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#drainage-area) of 20 acres or more shall be designed by a [professional engineer](./Article_150_Definitions.md#professional-engineer) registered in the [State of Missouri](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/Home.aspx). Prior to construction of such, detailed design plans and specifications shall be submitted to the [County Engineer](./Article_150_Definitions.md#county-engineer) for design review and compliance with State of Missouri standards. The professional engineer shall certify that the dam has been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications and State of Missouri standards.

**4. Setback Requirements**
No [pond](./Article_150_Definitions.md#pond) or lake shall be located closer than 50 feet to any county, state or city road, [street](./Article_150_Definitions.md#street) or road [right-of-way](./Article_150_Definitions.md#right-of-way).

**5. Utility Restrictions**
No [pond](./Article_150_Definitions.md#pond) or lake shall impound water over a [utility easement](./Article_150_Definitions.md#utility-easement), except a [drainage easement](./Article_150_Definitions.md#drainage-easement), or over an existing utility line including sewage lateral fields. Where impounded waters will back up on to other (off-site) [property](./Article_150_Definitions.md#property), water impoundment easements shall be required and recorded.

**6. Exemptions**
Ponds or lakes with a [surface area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#surface-area) of 1 acre or less (at normal pool level or normal spillway elevation) and used exclusively for an individual [dwelling unit's](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) sewage retention or for [agricultural purposes](./Article_150_Definitions.md#agricultural) shall be exempt from the standards of this Article.

### C. Retention Basins

When the [development](./Article_150_Definitions.md#development) of a site will substantially increase the [runoff](./Article_150_Definitions.md#runoff) of [stormwater](./Article_150_Definitions.md#stormwater) onto adjoining properties, the [County Engineer](./Article_150_Definitions.md#county-engineer) may require that [retention basins](./Article_150_Definitions.md#retention-basin) be provided onsite to control the rate of runoff.

### D. Dam Breach Studies

Decision-making bodies shall be authorized to require the preparation of a dam breach study for lakes with an area of 5 acres or more (at normal spillway elevation). When required, breach studies shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri.

As in the case of FIRM floodplain mapping, development shall be discouraged within the designated dam breach area.


## 110.2 Stormwater Management

Stormwater is water from rain or melting snow that does not soak into the ground. It flows from rooftops, over paved areas and bare soil, and through sloped lawns. As it flows, this runoff collects and transports soil, manure, salt, pesticides, fertilizer, oil and grease, leaves, litter and other potential pollutants. Contaminants include: livestock waste, fuels and solvents, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers. Contrary to popular belief, most storm sewers do not carry storm water to wastewater treatment plants. Stormwater is unavoidable, but keeping harmful chemicals and materials out of runoff, as well as designing detention areas that would reduce the flows and, therefore, the amount of erosion can reduce its effects.

Soil type can affect surface water contamination. Although runoff occurs from all soil types, clay soils are more likely to cause surface water runoff because they are less permeable. Eroding soil is considered a water pollutant.

For additional information, contact the University of Missouri Extension Service, the Ray County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, [Missouri Department of Conservation](https://mdc.mo.gov/), and the Ray County Health Department.

### A. Practices that will reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality in streams

1. Cover bare soil with vegetable and flower gardens, grass seed, and natural prairie grass coverings.
2. Remove all debris from ditches and creeks and from areas where they might be swept into a channel.
3. Consider using materials other than concrete or asphalt for drives and walkways that would allow for more seepage into the ground.
4. Keep basement windows or doors sealed against leaks.
5. Slope the yard away from the foundation to prevent water from pooling near the structure.
6. Use downspouts to carry water from the roof onto grassy areas.
7. Consider a landscaping layout engineered to reduce runoff.
8. Pump and repair on-site septic systems on a regular basis.
9. Replace septic systems if it is more than 30 years old, made of soil or undersized for any additions you have made to your house.
10. Do not drive vehicles on the drain field.
11. Do not pave, build, or pile heavy objects on a drain field.
12. Divert roof runoff and other surface runoff away from the drain field.
13. Do not dispose of tissues, diapers, sanitary napkins, cigarette butts and other solid waste down the toilet.
14. Paints, solvents, acids, drain cleaners, oils and pesticides can pass untreated through your system and contaminate the groundwater.
15. Consider the individual characteristics of the site when building; such as soil type and depth; depth to bedrock; depth to the water table; and location of wetlands, streams, or other surface water.

These Zoning Regulations may require all development of more than 20 acres to submit a stormwater plan for review.

### B. Stream Protection

No person shall knowingly deposit or dump trash, debris, or other obstacles into a Ray County active stream, or otherwise pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse.

### C. Stream Buffer Setbacks

This stream buffer setback ordinance is intended to protect and maintain the native vegetation along all stream systems within Ray county jurisdictional authority. This ordinance establishes minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers to protect the streams, wetlands and floodplains of Ray County; to protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes and other significant water resources within Ray County; to protect Ray County's riparian and aquatic ecosystems; and to provide for the environmentally sound use of Ray County's land resources.

**1. Structure Setback Requirements**
No structures shall be constructed within 50' of the stream bank, or in no case within 100' of the centerline of an active stream channel.

**2. Drainage Construction**

Temporary storage tanks of 10,000+ gallons liquid gas must have a Conditional Use Permit and conform to the restrictions that may be required to allow the installation of such a tank.


## 110.6 Floodplain Management

### A. Floodplain Designations

**1.** The special flood hazard areas of unincorporated Ray County are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

**2.** These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

### B. Statutory Authority

The regulations of this Article are adopted pursuant to the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the State of Missouri, including the statutory authority conferred by RSMo 49.600.

### C. Purpose

It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage waters
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands
6. Maintain the county's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d)

### D. Objectives

The objectives of the regulations of this Article are:

1. To protect human life and health
2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas

### E. Applicability

These regulations apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Ray County.

### F. Compliance

No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.

### G. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions

This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

### H. Interpretation

In the interpretation and application of this Article all provisions shall be: considered as minimum requirements; liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

### I. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability

The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of Ray County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

## 110.7 Floodplain Definitions

**Base Flood** - The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also referred to as the "100-year flood").

**Substantial Improvement** - Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement.


## 110.8 Floodplain Administration and Procedures

### A. Designation of Administrator

The Planning and Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this Article.

### B. Permit Required

A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard. Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the administrator and may include, but not be limited to:

1. Description of the work to be covered by the permit
2. Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done
3. Indication of the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended
4. Such other information as the administrator may require

### C. Review of Applications

The administrator shall review all applications for permits and shall require that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law.

### D. Inspection

The administrator shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and the requirements of this Article.

## 110.9 General Flood Hazard Reduction Standards

### A. General Standards

In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
3. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage
4. All new construction and substantial improvements shall have electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding

### B. Utilities

1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
2. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters
3. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding

### C. Subdivision Requirements

1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage
3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards
4. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which contains at least 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is less

## 110.11 Floodplain Standards for Manufactured Housing Units and Mobile Homes

All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Special Flood Hazard Areas on sites:

1. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision
2. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision
3. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
4. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood

The manufactured home must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

## 110.12 Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding

Located within the AO and AH zones established on the community's FIRM are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

## 110.13 Standards for Floodways

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 110.6 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

2. If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 110.

## 110.14 Floodplain Standards for Recreational Vehicles

All recreational vehicles placed on sites within A1-30, AH, and AE zones on the community's FIRM either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
3. Meet the permit requirements of Article 110.8 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Article 110.11.

A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

## 110.15 Floodplain Variances

### A. Appeal Board

The Ray County Board of Zoning Appeals as established by [Article 20](./Article_20_Review_Decision_Making_Bodies.md) shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Article.

### B. Conditions for Variances

Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Article.

### C. Variance Procedures

In passing upon such applications, the appeal board, shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Article, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable
6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges

### D. Conditions Upon Variances

1. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result
2. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief
3. Variances shall only be issued upon showing a good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Article 110.9, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances

### E. Variance Notification

Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

## 110.16 Floodplain Nonconformities

The lawful use of any building, structure, or land existing at the time of the enactment of this Article may be continued, although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Article, except:

1. No such structure may be enlarged, extended, or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity without conforming to the standards established by this Article
2. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a more restrictive use provided that it is in accord with the regulations of the zone in which it is located
3. If any nonconforming use is discontinued for a period in excess of one year, any subsequent use of the same building, structure, or land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Article

## 110.17 Floodplain Violations

Any violation of the provisions of this Article by failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Ray County from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

## 110.18 Floodplain Amendments

The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this Article and any amendments thereto may from time to time be amended in accordance with procedures set forth in [Article 30](./Article_30_Development_Review_Procedures.md).
