It is the purpose of this Article to require [developers](./Article_150_Definitions.md#developer) to pay a prorata share of the cost of improving existing county roadways abutting their project to the Ray County Road Standards. The amount of road improvement fee required is included in this Article. Developers are only responsible for the amount of additional traffic created by a project, not any traffic generated by the [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) on the [property](./Article_150_Definitions.md#property) at the time of application.

## 90.2 Administration

The County Commission shall be responsible for the administration of this Article. The County Commission shall be responsible for developing administrative procedures for road improvement, considering changes in the land use and density, establishing standards for the improvements, and all other activities related to the intent of the program.

## 90.3 Applicability

The fees required by this Article shall be imposed upon all [development](./Article_150_Definitions.md#development) occurring after June 10, 2005.

[Development](./Article_150_Definitions.md#development) for the purpose of any activity requiring [platting](./Article_150_Definitions.md#plat), replatting, or a [building permit](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building-permit), where fees were not previously paid, shall be deemed eligible for payment.

## 90.4 Effect on Other Regulations
