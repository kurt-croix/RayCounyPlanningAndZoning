# Article 70 - Density and Dimensional Standards

## 70.1 Density and Dimensional Standards Table

The following table summarizes the density and dimensional standards applicable in the Zoning Regulations' base zoning districts. In the event of conflict between this table and the standards listed in Article 40.3 through Article 40.15, this table shall control.

**See: [Density and Dimensional Standards Table](tables/density_dimensional_standards.md)**

## 70.2 Measurements, Computations and Exceptions

### A. Density

Density refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land area. Density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units on a site by the gross area (in acres) of the site on which the dwelling units are located. The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards will be met. The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a justification for adjusting other dimensional or development standards.

### B. Lot Area

Lot area refers to the horizontal land area within lot lines. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of these Zoning Regulations except in the following cases:

1. The minimum lot area standards of these Zoning Regulations shall not be construed to prohibit the construction of a detached house on a legal lot, provided that it is constructed in compliance with all applicable setback standards.

2. Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot area standards.

### C. Lot Width

![Diagram 01](images/diagram_01.png)

Lot width is measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the front lot line or its chord and located the minimum front setback distance from the front lot line.

### D. Lot Depth

![Diagram 02](images/diagram_02.png)

Lot depth is measured from the center (mid-point) of the front lot line to the center (mid-point) of the rear lot line.

### E. Setbacks

Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this Article. Setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this Article.

#### 1. Exceptions to Setbacks

Every part of a required setback must be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as set out in this sub-Article:

a. Trees, shrubbery or other landscape features may be located within any required setback;

b. Fences and walls may be located within any required setback, subject to Article 60.3F;

c. Driveways and sidewalks may be located within any required setback;

d. Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles, may be located within any required setback.

e. Signs, where permitted, may be located within any required setback but may no obstruct views of vehicular traffic;

f. Uncovered porches, uncovered steps to building entrances, uncovered patio decks and uncovered balconies may extend up to 10 feet into any required front, rear or street side setback and up to 3 feet into any required interior side setback;

g. Openwork fire balconies and fire escapes may extend up to 3½ feet into any required setback;

h. Sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, eaves and other architectural features may extend up to 3 feet into any required setback;

i. Off-street parking and loading areas may be located within required front or rear setbacks, subject to Article 100.1D.1;

j. Chimneys and flues may extend up to 2 feet into any required setback;

k. Accessory structures may be located within setbacks only if expressly stated in Article 60.3;

l. Solar panels and other apparatus needed for the operation of active and passive solar energy systems, including but not limited to, overhangs, movable insulating walls and roofs, detached solar collectors, reflectors, and piping may project into a required rear setback by up to 10 feet and into a side setback by up to 3 feet. In all cases, however, they must be located at least 3 feet from all lot lines; and

m. Satellite dish antennas may be placed in required rear setbacks.

#### 2. Reduction for Public Purpose

When an existing setback is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining setback is at least 50 percent of the required minimum setback for the district in which it is located, then that remaining setback will be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of these Zoning Regulations.

#### 3. Alleys and Rear Setbacks

In computing the depth of a rear setback for any lot abutting an alley, one-half the width of such alley may be included in the rear setback dimension.

### F. Building Coverage

Building coverage refers to the area of a lot covered by buildings (principal and accessory) or roofed areas, as measured along the outside wall at ground level, and including all projections, other than open porches, fire escapes, canopies and the first 2 feet of a roof overhang.

### G. Height

Building height refers to the vertical distance between the average finished grade (based on an average of the highest and lowest ground points) at the base of the building being measured and: 1) the average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a gable, hip or gambrel roof; 2) the highest point of a mansard roof; or 3) the highest point of the coping of a flat roof.

#### 1. Fences or Walls

In the case of fences or walls, height shall be measured from ground level on the higher side of the fence or wall.

#### 2. Exemptions from Height Limits

The height limitations contained herein shall not apply to any of the following:

a. grain bins or other farm buildings in the R-A and R-1 districts;

b. electrical power transmission lines;

c. belfries, cupolas, spires, domes, monuments, flagpoles, chimneys, radio/television receiving antennas or chimney flues; or

d. bulkhead, elevator, water tank, or any other similar structure or necessary mechanical appurtenance extending above the roof of any building if such structure does not occupy more than 33 percent of the area of the roof.

#### 3. Exceptions for Towers and Antennae

Towers and antennae for 2-way or commercial broadcast, wireless telecommunications, or towers for wind-powered generators or pumps may be allowed to extend above the district height standards if approved by Conditional Use Permit.
