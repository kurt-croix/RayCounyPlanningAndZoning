# Article 70 - Density and Dimensional Standards

## 70.1 Density and Dimensional Standards Table

The following table summarizes the density and dimensional standards applicable in the Zoning Regulations' base [zoning districts](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district). In the event of conflict between this table and the standards listed in [Article 40.3](./Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#403-r-a-agricultural-district) through [Article 40.15](./Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#4015-op-open-spaceparkpublic-uses-district), this table shall control.

**See: [Density and Dimensional Standards Table](tables/density_dimensional_standards.md)**

## 70.2 Measurements, Computations and Exceptions

### A. Density

Density refers to the number of [dwelling units](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) per unit of land area. Density is calculated by dividing the number of [dwelling units](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) on a site by the gross area (in acres) of the site on which the [dwelling units](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) are located. The number of [dwelling units](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards will be met. The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a justification for adjusting other dimensional or development standards.

### B. Lot Area

[Lot area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-area) refers to the horizontal land area within [lot lines](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line). No [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) permit or development approval may be issued for a [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) that does not meet the minimum [lot area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-area) requirements of these Zoning Regulations except in the following cases:

1. The minimum [lot area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-area) standards of these Zoning Regulations shall not be construed to prohibit the construction of a detached house on a legal [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot), provided that it is constructed in compliance with all applicable [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) standards.

2. Utilities using land or an unoccupied [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum [lot area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-area) standards.

![Diagram 01](images/diagram_01.png)

Lot width is measured between side [lot lines](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line) along a line that is parallel to the [front](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-front) [lot line](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line) or its chord and located the minimum [front](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-front) [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) distance from the [front](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-front) [lot line](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line).

### D. Lot Depth

![Diagram 02](images/diagram_02.png)

Lot depth is measured from the center (mid-point) of the [front](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-front) [lot line](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line) to the center (mid-point) of the [rear](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-rear) [lot line](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-line).

### E. Setbacks

[Setbacks](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) and the property line of the [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) on which the [structure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#structure) is located, except as modified by the standards of this Article.

l. Solar panels and other apparatus needed for the operation of active and passive solar energy systems, including but not limited to, overhangs, movable insulating walls and roofs, detached solar collectors, reflectors, and piping may project into a required [rear](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-rear) [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) by up to 10 feet and into a [side](./Article_150_Definitions.md#yard-side) [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) by up to 3 feet.

#### 2. Reduction for Public Purpose

When an existing [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) is at least 50 percent of the required minimum [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) for the district in which it is located, then that remaining [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) will be deemed to satisfy the minimum [setback](./Article_150_Definitions.md#setback) standards of these Zoning Regulations.

#### 3. Alleys and Rear Setbacks

[Building height](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building-height) refers to the vertical distance between the average finished grade (based on an average of the highest and lowest ground points) at the base of the [building](./Article_150_Definitions.md#building) being measured and: 1) the average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a gable, hip or gambrel roof; 2) the highest point of a mansard roof; or 3) the highest point of the coping of a flat roof.
