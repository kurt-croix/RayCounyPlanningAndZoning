Article 30 Development Review Procedures


30.1  General


A.        Authority to File Applications
        Applications for development approval under these Zoning Regulations may be filed by: the property owner of record, a purchaser under a contract for sale from the record owner, or the duly authorized agent of the record property owner. County officials shall be authorized to require proof of legal authority to take the action sought. 


B.        Form of Application
        Applications required under this Article must be submitted on forms and in such numbers as required by the official responsible for accepting the application.
C.        Fees


        1.        Application Filing Fees
                Applications must be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee established by County Commission. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by Review and or Decision-Making Bodies.  See Article 160.


2. Special Hearing Deposit


                a.        Generally
                        Where the total time of a hearing is expected to exceed 2 hours, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a special hearing expense deposit shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the application filing fee.  Special hearing deposits are to cover actual expenses.  The required deposit amounts have been established by County Commission. At any point prior to the conclusion of all hearings on a matter, the County Commission may, for good cause and based on anticipated actual costs, require a deposit to exceed the amount required for applications falling in the “Other” category of “Special Hearing Deposit,” as shown in the Fee Schedule of Article 160.


                b.        Application Review
                        At the time of application filing, the applicant shall state the number of witnesses and the amount of time the applicant anticipates for the presentation of all evidence to applicable review and decision-making bodies. The application must be accompanied by a list of witnesses and exhibits. The Planning and Zoning Administrator will review all applications and make a determination of whether the hearing is likely to exceed 2 hours in length. Such determination shall be based upon: (1) the information supplied in the application, (2) the expected amount of public input, and (3) the Planning and Zoning Administrator’s experience with local practices.  If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator that the public hearing will exceed 2 hours in length, the applicant shall be subject to the special hearing deposit provisions of this Sub-Article.
                c.        Deposit Required
                        If at any time either before the filing of the application, or prior to a final decision of the applicable decision-making body, the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that the hearings are likely to exceed 2 hours in length, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of this determination and order the applicant to post a special hearing expense deposit, which shall be held in an account by the County Treasurer in a depository established for that purpose by the County Commission.  Upon the issuance of such order by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, all proceedings upon the application shall be stayed until the deposit is received by the county.  After such a stay is in effect for a period of 14 calendar days and the deposit is not made with the county, the application shall be dismissed, without prejudice against re-filing of the application.


                d.        Escrow Account Established
                        There shall be an escrow account established under the supervision of the County Treasurer's Office for each case for which the applicant pays an expense deposit.  The County Treasurer shall disburse payment from the escrow account upon billings supplied by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and approved by the County Commission.  These billings shall reflect the actual charges incurred which will be charged against the amount on deposit in escrow.  When each billing is made, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall simultaneously mail a copy of the billing to the applicant at the address listed in the application.


                e.        Additional Deposits
                        At any time that the escrow account falls below a balance of 20 percent of the initial total expense deposit, the County Treasurer shall immediately inform the Planning and Zoning Administrator, whereupon the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall write to the applicant at the address shown on the application and direct the applicant to make deposit equal to the amount of the initial expense deposit.  After the Planning and Zoning Administrator make such order, all proceedings on the application shall be stayed until the county receives the additional deposit.  If the additional deposit is not received within 14 calendar days of said order, or if the applicant indicates a refusal to make such additional deposit, the application shall be dismissed without prejudice against re-filing.
        
                f.        Refunds
                        Upon final disposition of the application or dismissal of the application, the balance of the deposit in escrow with the County Treasurer, after all expense payments are made, shall be returned to the applicant upon the applicant’s written request.


D.          Complete Application
                Applications that do not include required information or that are not accompanied by required fees will be returned to the applicant and no further processing of the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected.  Applications will be reviewed for completeness within 10 days of filing.  If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is complete, the application will be processed.  If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with a written explanation of the application’s deficiencies.


E.        Preapplication Conferences
        All applicants are encouraged to schedule and attend a preapplication conference meeting with Planning and Zoning Department staff prior to submitting an application for review under this Article. The purpose of a preapplication conference is to inform the applicant of applicable procedures, submittal requirements, development standards, and other pertinent matters before the applicant finalizes the development proposal. Staff opinions presented during a preapplication meeting are informational only and do not represent a commitment on behalf of the county regarding the acceptability of the development proposal.


F.        Establishment of Processing Cycles
        Officials responsible for accepting applications, after consulting with review and decision-making bodies, may promulgate processing cycles for applications. Processing cycles may establish:


        1.        Deadlines for receipt of complete applications;


        2.        Dates of regular meetings;


        3.        The scheduling of staff reviews and staff reports on complete applications;


        4.        All required steps in the application process (including public hearings, and reviews by other agencies); and


        5.        Required time frames for action by review and decision-making bodies.


G.        Planning and Zoning Administrator and Agency Review
        In conducting required reviews, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to distribute the application and other submittals to other departments and agencies for the purpose of soliciting comments and ensuring that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements.  The Technical Review Committee (TRC) may be convened to review technical aspects of applications.  See Article 20.4C.


H.        Notices
        All notices required under these Zoning Regulations must: (1) indicate the time and place of all scheduled public hearings; (2) describe the property involved in the application by street address, legal description or map; (3) describe the nature, scope and purpose of the proposal; and (4) indicate the location and source of additional information about the proposal.


        1.        Written Notice
a.        Unless otherwise expressly stated, when the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that written notice be provided, the official responsible for accepting the application shall provide written notice by regular mail to all owners of the subject property and all property owners within 600 feet of the subject property. (RSMo 64.863) Written notice shall also be sent by regular mail to the City Clerk of any municipality within 1½ miles of the subject property. (RSMo 64.830,64.860)
                b.        Written notices shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing. 


                c.        The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Planning and Zoning Department with a list of the names and addresses of the owners of record of all property within 600 feet of the subject property.  The ownership information shall be obtained from a licensed abstractor, title company, registered surveyor or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant.  This information should be provided in electronic and printed form.  Failure to notify all adjoiners may invalidate the public notice requirements and cause the application to be tabled until proper notification is completed.


        2.        Published Notice
                When the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that notice be published in the newspaper, the official responsible for accepting the application shall ensure that notice is published in a newspaper of general circulation within Ray County at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing. 


        3.        Constructive Notice
                Minor technical deviations from specified notice requirements shall not be deemed to impair notice where there is actual notice.  Written notice shall be conclusively presumed to be properly given if placed, postage prepaid, with the United States Postal Service addressed in accordance with the list provided by the applicant.  When required written notices have been properly given, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action.  In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the subject property shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the body hearing the matter shall determine whether there was compliance with the notice requirements of this Article.


        4.        Delay in County Commission Hearing
                If there is a delay in forwarding a recommendation to the County Commission based on technical reasons, and no specific date is announced at the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing, written notice shall be sent by regular mail to all adjoiners within 600 feet at least 15 days prior to the County Commission hearing at which the application will be heard.


I.        Action by Review and DecisionMaking Bodies


        1.        Review and decision-making bodies may take any action on an application that is consistent with the notice given, including approving the application, approving the application in modified form or denying the application. Decision-making bodies shall also be authorized to remand an application back to a review body for further consideration and recommendation.


2. Review bodies may recommend and decisionmaking bodies may modify or allow amendments to the application if the effect of the modifications or amendments is to allow a less intensive use or zoning district than indicated in the application or to reduce the impact of the development or to reduce the amount of land area included in the application. (See Zoning District Hierarchy, Article 40.1)


        3.        Decisionmaking bodies may not approve an application for a greater density of development, a more intensive use, a more intensive zoning district, reduced setbacks, more dwelling units, greater height, more access points or fewer improvements than indicated in the notice.

30.8  Planned Unit Developments


A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of
development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development.  PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.


A.        Overview of Procedure 
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat.  Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.


        1.        Preapplication Conference
Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as Missouri Department of Conservation, Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.  The purpose of this preapplication conference is to discuss the proposal and the applicable development review procedures.
        2.        Application
A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.  No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. 


        3.        PUD Concept Plan
A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken. 


                a.   The PUD Concept Plan is not intended to be a highly detailed site plan, but rather to
provide enough information to officials to allow an accurate determination of the merits of a proposed project prior to beginning detailed planning work. Much of the information required at the Concept Plan stage can be conveyed in written form, although some generalized drawings will likely be required to comply with the following list of required information. (Figure 30.8-1)


                b.        The PUD Concept Plan is reviewed with respect to such issues as density, including the number, type, and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on surrounding areas; and the adequacy of facilities and services.  The result of this review is the establishment of the basic parameters for development of the PUD.  PUD Concept Plan approval establishes the maximum development “envelope” with regard to density, lot sizes, overall scale, open space, environmental protection, and other land development and service provision issues.


    Figure 30.8-1

                        Written and Published notice of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s public hearing shall be provided in accordance with Article 30.1H-1 and Article 30.1H-2.


                d.        Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator
                        The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Concept Plan application in light of the PUD zoning standards of Article 80 and all other applicable development standards and planning policies. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall provide a copy of the report to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant.


                e.        Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
                        The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Concept Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Concept Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.


                f.        Review and Action—County Commission
                        After receiving the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the County Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposed PUD Concept Plan. If the County Commission acts to approve the PUD Concept Plan, it shall establish required time frames for development of the entire PUD and its individual phases, if any.




                g.        PUD Concept Plan Review Criteria
Applications for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be approved if the County Commission determines that the following criteria are met:


1)        The PUD Concept Plan complies with the PUD standards of Figure 30.8-1;


2)        The county and other agencies will be able to provide necessary public services, facilities, and programs to serve the development proposed, at the time the property is developed;


3)        The development is consistent with and implements the planning goals and 
        objectives contained in Comprehensive Plan and other adopted policy
        documents;


                        4)        The PUD Concept Plan is consistent with sound planning practice and the development will promote the general welfare of the county; and
 
5)        A PUD is necessary to address a unique situation or represents a substantial
        benefit to the county, compared to what could have been accomplished through
        strict application of otherwise applicable base zoning district standards; and


6.  The same development could not be accomplished through the use of other   
        techniques, such as rezoning to a non-PUD district or Variances.


                h.        Effect of PUD Concept Plan Approval
                        Approval of a PUD Concept Plan shall constitute acceptance of the overall planning concepts for the proposed PUD development and is a prerequisite for the filing of a PUD Final Plan and approval of a PUD zoning classification.


                i.        Lapse of PUD Concept Plan Approval
                        An approved PUD Concept Plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a PUD Final Plan for the PUD (or a phase of the PUD) has not been approved within 2 years of the date of approval by the County Commission of the PUD Concept Plan. In the event of such lapse, the PUD zoning classification shall be of no effect, and the property shall be developed solely in accordance with the underlying zoning classification.  In the event of lapse of approval pursuant to this Article, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall initiate action to remove the land from the PUD overlay zoning district and may initiate action to rezone the property to its former base zoning district classification.


        4.        PUD Zoning District Map Amendment
                After approval of a PUD Concept Plan, or concurrently with the processing of a PUD Concept Plan, a Zoning District Map amendment request for PUD zoning may be reviewed and approved. PUD zoning requests shall be processed in accordance with the Zoning District Map amendment procedures of Article 30.3.


        5.        PUD Final Plan
                The PUD Final Plan is the document upon which building permits and other applicable approvals are issued.  The PUD Final Plan review stage is the point at which developers bring forward detailed plans for carrying out the type of project conceptually approved during PUD Concept Plan review.  The applicant must submit the detailed and technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards, requirements, and conditions have been met. 


                a.        Application
                        After approval of a PUD zoning classification and before lapse of a PUD Concept Plan, a complete application for PUD Final Plan approval must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. A PUD Final Plan application may include the entire area covered in the PUD Concept Plan or it may include one or more phases of the approved PUD Concept Plan. The final PUD plan shall include the same information as required with a Preliminary Subdivision Plat (see Figure 30.6-1).


                b.        Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator
                        The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Final Plan application in light of the approved PUD Concept Plan and all other applicable development standards and planning policies.


                c.        Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
                        The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Final Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Final Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.        


                d.        Review and Action—County Commission
                        The County Commission shall consider the PUD Final Plan application and act to approve or deny the PUD Final Plan application. 


                e.        PUD Final Plan Review Criteria
                        A PUD Final Plan shall be approved by the County Commission if it is determined by the County Commission to be in substantial compliance with the approved PUD Concept Plan.  The PUD Final Plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the PUD Concept Plan so long as, when compared with the PUD Concept Plan, it does not result in:


 1)         An increase in project density or intensity, including the number of housing
                 units per acre or the amount of nonresidential floor area per acre;


 2)         A change in the mix of housing types or the amount of land area devoted to
         nonresidential uses;


 3)         A reduction in the amount of open space;
         4)         Any change to the vehicular system which results in a significant change in the amount or location of streets, parking areas, or access to the PUD;


 5)         Any change within 50 feet of any residential zoning district;


         6)         Any change determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission to         
                 represent an increase in development intensity; or


 7).         A substantial change in the layout of buildings.


        6.        Final Plats
To complete the platting process, the applicant need only to submit and record a Final Plat for the phase(s) under development in accordance with Figure 30.6-2.  


a.  The PUD Final Plan and the Final Plat for the first phase(s) may be reviewed 
     concurrently, at the option of the applicant.


b.  A note shall be included on the Final Plat stating:
          [Example:] “Rezoned to Residential (R-1, R-3) Zoning District with a Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlay.” 


                 c.  A Final Plat shall be recorded for each phase of the plan after the infrastructure to be built by the developer has been constructed and approved, or adequate bonding or letter of credit submitted to the County.


30.9  Conditional Use Permits
The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use.  The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another.  The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land.  Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.


A.        Application Filing
        Conditional Use Permit applications shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department on forms available in the Planning and Zoning Department.


        1.        Adjacent Property Owners
                The applicant for a proposed conditional use permit shall provide the Planning and Zoning Department with a list of names and addresses of the owners of record of all property within 600 feet of the property in question, as specified by RSMo 64.863.  A property abstractor, title company, registered surveyor, or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant shall have originated such list.


2. Water Supply Approval        
        Written approval from the respective public water supply district (PWSD) or a municipal water supplier for the proposed project shall be submitted with the application. If water service from the PWSD is not available, this should be noted in 
                writing from the district.  If the project is not within the boundaries of any PWSD, and not capable to be served by any other water supplier, arrangements shall be made in accordance with this Article.


3. Sanitary Sewer Approval
                In some instances, written approval must be submitted at the time of application from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR). If sanitary sewer service is to be provided from a sewer district or private sewer company, written approval of such service shall be provided from the service provider with the preliminary plat application.


4. Ray County Road and Bridge or Special Road District Approval
                Written approval from the Ray County Road and Bridge or Special Road District of all roadways and accesses shall be submitted with the application.  


5. Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) approval
                If the project abuts a State maintained highway, written approval from the MoDOT shall be submitted with the application.


6.  Legal Description
                One copy of a legal description of the property on which the use is to be located.

                a)        the proposed use complies with all applicable provisions of these Zoning Regulations;


                b)        the proposed use in its proposed location will not have a substantial adverse impact on the public health, safety or general welfare;

                b.        If the County Commission denies a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in the I-1 or I-2 zoning districts, an application for the same or more intensive use on the subject parcel, whether the parcel is in its original configuration or expanded or reduced in area, shall not be accepted for 5 years from the date of the County Commission’s action to deny the Conditional Use Permit.


1)        The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit a re-filing of a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning after 6 months if the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines, based on clear and convincing evidence provided by the applicant, that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the County Commission denied the rezoning which is the result of new facts that were not discoverable by the applicant during the previous proceedings with the use of reasonable diligence or as a result of material facts which have arisen since the previous decision. Such showings must be made prior to acceptance of the application.


2)        The decision of the Planning and Zoning Administrator on a request to re-file a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning must be provided in writing and forwarded to the applicant with a copy of the decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission within 30 days of the submission of an application.

        2.        Application Filing
Sign Plan applications shall be submitted to the Building Official on forms available from the Building Official.  In addition, a graphic shall be submitted that will give the location of the proposed sign(s) on the property measured in feet, accurate dimensions of the proposed sign(s), type of construction proposed, lighting, language to appear on the sign, logos, and other information to illustrate the proposed sign.




3.        Staff Review and Action
The Building Official shall review each proposed sign application in accordance with the Sign Plan review criteria set forth in Article 30.9A and act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the Sign Plan.


4.        Sign Plan Approval Criteria
A Sign Plan may be approved only if the Building Official determines that all of the following approval criteria have been met:


1. the Sign Plan complies with all applicable standards of this Land Development  
      Code, including the sign regulations of Article 120; 
                
b.        the Sign Plan is consistent with any approved or concurrently proposed PUD, subdivision or site plan for the site.


.


B.        Individual Sign Permits


        1.        Applicability
Signs identified with a “P” in Table 120-1 shall be erected, installed or created only in accordance with a duly issued and valid sign permit. Sign permits shall be required for new signs, new sign structures and prior to changing the sign face on an existing sign structure.
        
        2.        Application Filing
Sign Permit applications shall be submitted to the Building Official on forms available from the Building Official.


        3.        Staff Review and Action
The Building Official shall review each proposed Sign Permit application for the purpose of determining whether the proposed sign complies with all applicable sign regulations of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable. Based on that review, the Building Official shall:


                a.        Issue the Sign Permit, if the sign complies in every respect with the standards of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable; or


                b.        Deny the sign permit if the sign fails in any way to comply with the standards of Article 120 or the applicable Sign Plan.


        3.        Lapse of Approval/Inspections        
If an approved sign has not been erected or otherwise put in place within 6 months of the issuance of the Sign Permit, the Sign Permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. The applicant shall request that the Building Official inspect the sign at the end or following the end of the 6-month period following issuance of the Sign Permit. If, upon inspection, the construction is substantially incomplete, the Building Official shall give the property owner or tenant notice that the Sign Permit has lapsed. If, upon inspection, the construction is found to be substantially complete but not in full compliance with Article 120 or other applicable codes, the Building Official shall give the property owner or tenant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the Sign Permit shall lapse and the sign shall be removed immediately. The failure to remove sign for which permits have lapsed shall be unlawful.
















30.11  Variances

D.        Approval Criteria


        1.    Use Variances
A Variance that would have the effect of allowing a use that the underlying zoning district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment if the Board of Zoning Adjustment determines that all of the following conditions have been met:


                a.        the requested Variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;


                b.        the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;


                c.        the strict application of the provisions of which the Variance is requested will constitute a practical difficulty because the property cannot be used for an otherwise permitted use without coming into conflict with applicable site development standards; and 




                d.        the Variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare, nor destroy the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
                


        2.        Non-Use Variances
A Variance that does not have the effect of allowing a use that the underlying zoning district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment if the Board of Zoning Adjustment determines that all of the following conditions have been met:


                a.        the requested Variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;


                b.        the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;


                c.   the strict application of the provisions of which a Variance is requested will constitute an unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application; and


                d.        the Variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare, nor destroy the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.


        3.        Conditions of Approval
In acting to approve a Variance, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of these Zoning Regulations, so long as the condition relates to a situation created or aggravated by the proposed use and is roughly proportional to its impact. Such conditions may include site design requirements and time limitations on the Variance.


        4.    Appeals
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment on a Variance application may present to the Circuit Court of Ray County a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.

40.2  Zoning District Hierarchy


References in these Zoning Regulations to less restrictive or more restrictive zoning districts are references to the “intensity” of development allowed, not necessarily the range of uses permitted. Under the hierarchy established by these Zoning Regulations, the R-A district is the most restrictive base-zoning district, while the I-2 district is the least restrictive base-zoning district.  Overlay and Special Purpose zoning districts are not included in the zoning district hierarchy.


40.3  R-A  Agricultural District        


A.        Description
The agricultural district (R-A) is primarily intended to help retain large tracts of land for agricultural and open space purposes and to minimize conflicts between agricultural uses and adjacent development. It is possible that parts of this district will change to more intense urban zoning districts as utility services are extended. Minimum lot area in R-A zoning shall be 19 acres, and shall have one single family residence. 


B.        Use Regulations
The following table shows which uses are allowed in the R-A district. For a summary of uses allowed in all zoning districts, see Article 60.1. (P = Permitted by-right; C= Allowed only if reviewed and approved as a Conditional Use (See Article 30.9)

Article 50   Overlay and Special Purpose Zoning Districts


50.1        Overlay and Special Purpose Zoning Districts Established
The following Overlay and Special Purpose zoning districts are hereby established:


 
	District Name
	Type
	

	

	

	PUD
	Planned Unit Development 
	Overlay District
	

	

	 
	OP  
	 Open space and Parks Master Plan
	 Overlay District
	                 


The PUD, Planned Unit Development district is an overlay zoning district that permits greater flexibility of land planning and site design than conventional zoning districts.  Its intended use is for large scale design-oriented developments, commercial, industrial and mixed-use developments.  The PUD regulations:


        1.        Provide flexibility in architectural design, placement, and clustering of buildings; use of open areas and outdoor living areas; provision of circulation facilities and parking; and related site and design considerations; 


2. Encourage the conservation of natural features; 


3. Provide for efficient use of public services and improvements; 


4. Encourage and preserve opportunities for energy efficient development;


        5.        Promote attractive and functional business environments in nonresidential zoning districts that are compatible with surrounding development; and


        6.        Promote an attractive and safe living environment in residential zoning districts.


A.        Applicability
A PUD district may be approved only when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the County Commission that a proposed PUD project would result in a greater benefit to the county than would development under conventional zoning district regulations.


B.        Developer's Statement of Intent
Each PUD Concept Plan application shall contain a statement from the applicant describing how the proposed development departs from the otherwise applicable standards of this Land Development Code and how the proposed development, on balance, is an improvement over what would be required under otherwise applicable standards.


C.        Review and Approval Procedures
PUDs shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.8.




D.        Effect of other Zoning District Standards
Except as expressly authorized by the regulations of this Article and approved as part of a PUD plan, all of the standards of these Zoning Regulations apply to development within a PUD. Otherwise applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations may be modified by the County Commission as part of its approval of a PUD if such modifications are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and if the development is found to be an improvement over what would be required under otherwise applicable standards.


E.        Use Regulations
The County Commission shall determine the types of uses allowed within a PUD at the time of Concept Plan approval. Only uses that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan may be allowed within a PUD.


F.        Development Intensity
The total number of dwelling units and level of nonresidential development allowed within a PUD shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and not exceed the level that can be adequately served by public facilities. To evaluate the capacity of streets and other facilities 
serving a PUD, the Planning and Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to conduct a traffic impact study or other infrastructure capacity analysis to provide information on the development's expected impacts on existing and planned facilities.


G.        Roadway Access
Unless otherwise expressly approved during the PUD approval process, principal vehicular access to PUDs must be from collector and higher classification streets. Any PUD containing over 50 dwelling units or 30,000 square feet of nonresidential floor space must provide at least 2 access points, wherever possible.


I.        Open Space
        At least 30 percent of the gross land area in PUDs must consist of common open space.


J.        Preservation of Natural Features
Mature trees, vegetative cover, watercourses and other natural site features must be preserved to the maximum extent feasible.


K.        Additional Conditions
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend and the County Commission shall impose such other conditions as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of these Zoning Regulations such as a Drainage  and Stormwater Plan, shared sewage treatment facility plans and approvals from the PSC, and Construction Plans.  Such conditions and/or plans shall be submitted 4 weeks prior to the next scheduled public hearing and reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Department and the Highway Department. (Article 30.6A1i and 30.6D1d)




        
        .


  





The purpose of the Open Space and Parks Master Plan Overlay is to provide intentional and organized development of park and recreational facilities for the residents of Ray County.  The overall goal is to provide connections between historical sites, connections between neighborhoods, and provide ample open space for recreation.
B.        Parks Master Plan
No Master Plan has been developed for Ray County

E.  Animal Production
Animal production and accessory raising of farm animals shall be allowed only on lots or parcels having a minimum area of at least 19 acres, provided that all buildings used to house such farm animals are set back at least 100 feet from the front property line and at least 50 feet from side and rear property lines.
        
1. Animal production is limited to domestic farm animals such as cattle, horses, and chickens or as noted in Article 150.1, “Farm Animals.”


2.        Feedlots are permitted on agricultural zoned land subject to Missouri Department of Natural Resources regulations and with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit.

G.        Antennas and Towers (Commercial)


        1.        Federal Requirements
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC,   and any other agency or department of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.  These regulations shall also include radio frequency emissions.  If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by these Zoning Regulations shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 6 months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.  Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense, in accordance with this Article.


        2.        Abandoned Towers
Any tower that is no longer in use for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense.  Should this installation remain unused for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, then it shall be deemed abandoned, and the owner shall be notified that the tower will be demolished at the cost of the owner, by order of the County Commission.  A bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other form of surety acceptable to the county, shall be kept on file with the County Clerk's office equal to an amount of a binding bid for the demolition of the proposed tower structure, if the county deems the tower abandoned by the owner. Such binding bid and corresponding surety shall be updated every 5 years.  In the case of multiple operators sharing use of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations.


        3.        Location on County Property
Antenna supports or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the County Commission shall require a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  The placement of antennas on existing supports or towers shall be approved by the County Commission and may be exempt from the provisions of this Article. However, this shall not be construed to eliminate the requisite building permit.


4. Inspection
At least every 24 months, and at other times deemed reasonable and necessary by the Planning and Zoning Department, the tower shall be inspected by a structural engineer 
registered in the State of Missouri, who is regularly involved in the maintenance, inspection and/or erection of communication towers.  At a minimum, this inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the tower inspection check list provided in the Electronics Industries Association (EIA) Standard 222, "Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Support Structures." A copy of such inspection record shall be provided to the county.


        5.        Accessory Equipment Storage
Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the communication tower, unless repairs or necessary maintenance are being made to the tower.


        6.        Fences
Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than 6 feet in height, maintain a locked gate, and be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.  Signs shall also be posted on each outward face of the fence indicating "No Trespassing," "High Voltage" and any other pertinent information. 


        7.        Design and Construction
A building permit shall be issued for the construction of a tower, and meet all requirements of the county's building codes.  All plans and specifications shall be from a professional engineer, registered in the State of Missouri experienced in the design and/or analysis of communication towers.  Facilities should be architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and land uses in the zone district or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.


        8.        Lighting
Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority.  If lighting is required, the County Commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
        
        9.        Landscaping
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent property.  The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 4 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.  The landscaping may be placed outside of the fenced complex on the landowner's property through the use of a landscape easement, granted to the tower owner from the property owner, to maintain the landscaping.


        10.        Co-location
   Unless otherwise exempted in this Article, all towers shall be constructed for a capacity 
   of 3 times the intended use in order that secondary users may lease the balance of the    
   tower capacity at a fair market rate.  Proof must be presented to the county that there 
   are no other suitable sites within a 1-mile radius of the proposed tower site.  To 
   encourage co-location, the following table establishes the minimum number of users on 
   a tower based on its height:




Height (feet)
	

Minimum Number of Users
	

0–80
	

1
	

80–120 
	

2
	

Over 120 
	

3
	

The county shall be notified by letter of all additional users of the tower and related facilities. This letter shall also include an engineering certification that additional equipment was properly installed.  Public safety and emergency agencies shall, if technologically feasible, be allowed to co-locate on the tower without charge.


        11.        Accessory/Principal Uses
               Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses.  A different 
               existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of 
               an antenna or tower on such lot.  For purposes of determining whether the installation 
               of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not 
               limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such 
               requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or 
               towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. 


               Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the 
               provisions of these Zoning Regulations shall not be deemed to constitute the 
               expansion of a non-conforming use or structure.  Accessory uses shall include only 
               such buildings and facilities necessary for transmission functions and satellite ground 
               stations associated with them, but shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicle 
               storage area, nor other similar uses not necessary for the transmission function.

The County Commission may, upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, grant a deviation from the setback and separation standards.  In support of a deviation request from the separation requirements, the applicant shall submit a technical study acceptable to the county, which confirms that there are no other suitable sites available within the separation requirements. 


        13.        Height and Setback
   The maximum height for all wireless telecommunication antenna and their support   
   structures shall not exceed 300 total feet above ground level.  Towers and support 
   structures must be set back a minimum distance equal to 66 percent of the height of the 
   tower from all adjoining property lines.


        14.        Installation of Antennas on Existing Structures
No conditional use permit shall be required to install antennas on existing structures such as radio towers, elevated water storage structures, church steeples, silos, and other buildings, provided no structure height is added. When such antennas are installed on an existing structure, a building permit is required from the Planning and Zoning Department. The information submitted for the building permit by the applicant shall also include a report from a structural engineer, registered in the State of Missouri, indicating that the existing structure is capable of supporting the additional antenna. Such report shall be obtained by and at the expense of the applicant.


15. Permitted Districts
Commercial towers are allowed by a Conditional Use Permit in R-A, B-2, I-1 and I-2 zones only.


16. Transferring Ownership of an Existing Tower (Adopted January 18, 2012)
Because commercial towers periodically change ownership with the definition of the use of the structure changing, the Conditional Use Permit may be transferred with ownership.  Written request must be submitted to the Ray County Planning & Zoning Department a minimum of 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership.  The Planning & Zoning Department will then forward the request to the Ray County Commission for approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
H.        Attached Houses
Attached houses shall be allowed in the indicated districts, subject to the following standards.


        1.        Lot Width
                Attached housing is exempt from lot width standards.


        2.        Setbacks
No interior side setback is required on the “attached” side of a lot containing an attached house.  The street, side, and rear setback standards shall apply around the perimeter of an attached housing development.


        3.        Number of Units
                In the R-2 district, no single structure may contain more than 2 dwelling units.


I.        Aviation and Surface Transportation Facilities (Landing Fields)
        The following standards shall apply to airplane landing fields, public or private. 


        1.        The use shall be subject to all requirements pertaining to public general aviation airports as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration.


2. All Federal Aviation Administration recommended clear zones that are below 75 feet from ground elevation and not under the same ownership as the landing field shall be acquired as easements by the applicant.


3. Runways shall not be located within 1½ miles of any city or residential zoning district.


4. A private landing field shall not require a significant increase in services such as roads, water, or sewer.


5. All development within an aviation district is subject to the Airport Guidelines in the Comprehensive Plan and Article 50.4.


K.        Bed and Breakfast Inn

70.2  Measurements, Computations and Exceptions


A.        Density
Density refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land area.  Density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units on a site by the gross area (in acres) of the site on which the dwelling units are located.  The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards will be met.  The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a justification for adjusting other dimensional or development standards. 
B.        Lot Area
Lot area refers to the horizontal land area within lot lines.  No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of these Zoning Regulations except in the following cases:


1.        The minimum lot area standards of these Zoning Regulations shall not be construed to prohibit the construction of a detached house on a legal lot, provided that it is constructed in compliance with all applicable setback standards.


2.        Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot area standards.


C.        Lot Width
  

Lot width is measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the front lot line or its chord and located the minimum front setback distance from the front lot line. 
  

D.        Lot Depth
Lot depth is measured from the center (mid-point) of the front lot line to the center (mid-point) of the rear lot line.


E.        Setbacks
Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this Article. Setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this Article. 


        1.        Exceptions to Setbacks
Every part of a required setback must be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as set out in this sub-Article:


                a.        Trees, shrubbery or other landscape features may be located within any required setback;


                b.        Fences and walls may be located within any required setback, subject to Article 60.3F;
                 c.        Driveways and sidewalks may be located within any required setback;


4. Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles, may be located within any required setback.
                e.        Signs, where permitted, may be located within any required setback but may no obstruct views of vehicular traffic;


6. Uncovered porches, uncovered steps to building entrances, uncovered patio decks and uncovered balconies may extend up to 10 feet into any required front, rear or street side setback and up to 3 feet into any required interior side setback;


7. Openwork fire balconies and fire escapes may extend up to 3½ feet into any required setback;


                h.        Sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, eaves and other architectural features may extend up to 3 feet into any required setback; 


9. Off-street parking and loading areas may be located within required front or rear setbacks, subject to Article 100.1D.1;


                j.        Chimneys and flues may extend up to 2 feet into any required setback;


                k.        Accessory structures may be located within setbacks only if expressly stated in Article 60.3;


                l.        Solar panels and other apparatus needed for the operation of active and passive solar energy systems, including but not limited to, overhangs, movable insulating walls and roofs, detached solar collectors, reflectors, and piping may project into a required rear setback by up to 10 feet and into a side setback by up to 3 feet. In all cases, however, they must be located at least 3 feet from all lot lines; and


                m.        Satellite dish antennas may be placed in required rear setbacks.


1. Reduction for Public Purpose
                When an existing setback is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining setback is at least 50 percent of the required minimum setback for the district in which it is located, then that remaining setback will be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of these Zoning Regulations.


        3.        Alleys and Rear Setbacks
In computing the depth of a rear setback for any lot abutting an alley, one-half the width of such alley may be included in the rear setback dimension.






F.        Building Coverage
Building coverage refers to the area of a lot covered by buildings (principal and accessory) or roofed areas, as measured along the outside wall at ground level, and including all projections, other than open porches, fire escapes, canopies and the first 2 feet of a roof overhang.


  

G.        Height
Building height refers to the vertical distance between the average finished grade (based on an average of the highest and lowest ground points) at the base of the building being measured and: 1) the average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a gable, hip or gambrel roof; 2) the highest point of a mansard roof; or 3) the highest point of the coping of a flat roof. 
        
        1.        Fences or Walls
                In the case of fences or walls, height shall be measured from ground level on the higher side of the fence or wall.


        2.        Exemptions from Height Limits
                The height limitations contained herein shall not apply to any of the following:

                b.        electrical power transmission lines;


                c.        belfries, cupolas, spires, domes, monuments, flagpoles, chimneys, radio/television receiving antennas or chimney flues; or


4. bulkhead, elevator, water tank, or any other similar structure or necessary mechanical appurtenance extending above the roof of any building if such structure does not occupy more than 33 percent of the area of the roof.


        3.        Exceptions for Towers and Antennae
Towers and antennae for 2-way or commercial broadcast, wireless telecommunications, or towers for wind-powered generators or pumps may be allowed to extend above the district height standards if approved by Conditional Use Permit.
Article 80   Subdivision Design and Improvements


80.1  General


A.        Applicability
The standards of this Article shall apply to all subdivisions of land unless otherwise expressly exempted.


B.        Technical Specifications and Design Criteria
Standards and specifications for public improvements and technical subdivision design standards are addressed in the Ray County Road Standard. Compliance with the standards of the Ray County Road Standard shall be required on all publicly dedicated rights-of-way. 


C.        Exemptions
        The standards of this Article shall not apply to the following subdivisions:


        1.        A transaction between owners of adjoining unplatted property which involves only a change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons provided no additional tracts are created and such tracts comply with the lot size and setback standards of the underlying zoning district. 


        2.        Property which is created by adjoining unplatted tracts which involves the combination of contiguous parcels of land into one larger parcel. 


        3.        The conveyance of land for street or railroad rightofway, utility or drainage  easements, or other public utility purposes subject to local, state, or federal regulations, and where no new street or access easements are created.


        4.        The conveyance of land for public recreation, trails or similar easements and public purposes. 




5.   The division of land into tracts 40 acres or larger in area after the date of  
adoption of this Article, provided such tracts have at least 100 total feet of frontage along a state or county-maintained roadway, and access to the tracts and any remnant parcels comply with state minimum sight distance requirements.
The exemption for cemetery plots exempts those creating individual subdivision plots from the subdivision process. It does not exempt those creating a cemetery.
        8.                The division of land into cemetery plots, provided that such 
                        division complies with RSMo 214.


        9.                The division of land by any court action pursuant to the law of 
                  eminent domain.


10.    A division of property through the probate of an estate, or by 
                order or judgment of a court of law of competent jurisdiction of 
                the State of Missouri.


80.2  Layout and Design 


A.        Compliance with Plans and Regulations
        The design of subdivisions shall be consistent with:


        1.        The Comprehensive Plan and all other adopted plans and policies of the County Commission; and


        2.        The requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located and all other applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations.
 
B.        Traffic Movement and Pedestrian Circulation


        1.                 The design of subdivisions should create an integrated system of lots, streets,  
                          trails, and infrastructure that provides for efficient movement of people, 
                          bicycles, and automobiles within the subdivision and to and from adjacent 
                          development. 


        2.        All subdivisions should provide for the efficient movement of through traffic by providing a completely interconnected hierarchy of streets in order to avoid isolation of residential areas and over-reliance on arterial streets.


        3.        Subdivisions should be designed to provide safe and attractive pedestrian routes to nearby commercial centers, employment, recreation, and other uses.


4.  Street layouts should be uncomplicated, so that emergency services, public   
        services, and visitors can find their way to their destinations.


5.   The proliferation of individual driveways on state and county roads should be 
Avoided.  Homeowners are responsible for all maintenance of driveway easements.  Specific address signage may be required.


        6.                Residential subdivisions involving 5 or more lots should be served by internal street systems rather than relying on the state and county roads for direct access to all lots, unless exempted by the Ray County Road and Bridge or the state regulating 
                authority.  If the decision-making body allows direct residential driveway access to state or county roads, the decision-making body shall be authorized to require shared access drives and other mitigation measures to reduce the number of access points on to state and county roads and thereby promote public safety and efficient movement of traffic.


C.        Streetscape Appearance


1. Lot and street designs should be designed to avoid extended distances of back yard frontage on arterial streets, and where that cannot be avoided, buffering of back yards from those streets should be landscaped with buffers and fences.


        2.        Edges of subdivisions should include adequate landscaping and buffering to improve the image of the area, and to protect future residents of the subdivision and adjacent developments from adverse impacts caused by significant differences in use, development intensity, or development height.

It is the intent of the Comprehensive Plan to protect the natural environment of Ray County and provide for densities that would support common sanitary sewer systems either from existing municipalities, a regional sewer district, or private provider.  The Comprehensive Plan’s adopted growth strategy (Development Zones) is based largely on these goals.  Provisions set forth herein shall govern the provision of sanitary sewer service in the county. 


A.        General Standards
Sanitary sewer disposal connections shall be required of all properties and uses in the County according to the following general standards:


        1.        Rural Density Development Zone
Sanitary sewer service may be provided by onsite disposal methods (septic systems) approved by the Ray County Planning and Zoning Department. 


        2.        Low Density Development Zone
Sanitary sewer service may be provided by onsite disposal methods (septic systems approved by the Ray County Planning and Zoning Department. Additionally, if any lot of the subdivision lies within 1,000 feet and within the same service basin of a central sanitary sewer system with capacity to serve the subdivision, then onsite disposal systems will be prohibited and connection to the central system will be required.


        3.        Urban Density Development Zone
Sanitary sewer service will be provided through use of, or connection to, a central sanitary sewer system except for residences on lots zoned R-A, R-1, and R-1A unless such lots lie within 1,000 feet and within the same service basin of a central sanitary 
sewer system with capacity to serve the lots.  In that case, onsite disposal systems will be prohibited and connection to the central system will be required.


B.        Service and Ownership Requirement
        The subdivider and /or lot owners shall be required to install sanitary sewer facilities, or individual sewage disposal systems, designed in accordance with the rules, regulations and standards of the Missouri Clean Water Commission and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.  Installation of a central sanitary sewer system that is not connected to a municipal or other public authority treatment plant shall require the dedication of the treatment facility to a utility agency approved by the County Commission.  This provision shall not be interpreted as allowing the County Commission to approve control of a treatment facility by a property owners’ association.


C.        Connection Requirement
Sewage from a building or premises shall be discharged directly into the community or county sewage system when the system is available within 200 feet (or other applicable requirement) from the building or premises measured along a street, alley, or easement to the encasement of the sewer system.  Abandoned or disconnected septic tanks or pits shall be pumped out and filled with clean earth or sand, in accordance with State and County regulations.


D.        Adjoining Properties Service Requirement
Where a development is proposed to have a central sanitary sewer system and is adjacent to an undeveloped tract of land, the proposed sanitary sewer system should be extended to the exterior boundary lines of the proposed development so as to provide for future connection to the adjacent tract of land.


80.11  Other Utilities


A.        Electrical and Communication Lines
All telephone, cable television, electrical service and distribution lines shall be placed underground, except that this provision shall not include meters, service pedestals, transformers, three phase feeder lines, sub-transmission and transmission lines (34.5KV and above), electrical substations, and other such facilities as the utility may deem necessary to install utilizing overhead type construction. 
B.        Gas Meters
All gas meters must be located within 3 feet of the building foundation, and located within front yards in all subdivisions. 
C.        Water Towers
All private or public water towers will require a review and building permits from the Ray County Building Official.


D.        Blasting Permits
Any entity desiring to use blasting materials in their construction process must notify the Planning and Zoning Department, Building Official, County Sheriff, and all residents located within 1,000 feet of the blasting area at least 24 hours in advance of the blasting.


80.12  Stormwater Management


A.        Stormwater management is a requirement of all development within Ray County.  New development is required to be responsible for potential runoff onto and off of his property.  Specific requirements are noted in the “Technical Specifications and Design Criteria Manual” and “Drainage  Easements” Article 110.


B.        When required by the Planning and Zoning Commission, two copies of the final stormwater plan shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department for review by the County’s engineer, or designee, and one copy to the Ray County Highway Department.  Appropriate plan review and inspection fees will be paid at the time of submitting the plans.


C.   Criteria for stormwater plans shall include:
Methodology of analysis – In developments where the area contributing runoff is one hundred (100) acres or less, the Rational Method of calculating the quantity of runoff shall be utilized.  Development where the area contributing runoff exceeds one hundred (100) acres shall be designed using the unit hydrograph method (SCS) or other methodologies approved by the County Engineer.


1.  Criteria for drainage  system – Property adjacent to the study area which is undeveloped  
shall be considered as fully developed in accordance with the most probable  anticipated         future land use.  In areas where this cannot be adequately projected, the average runoff 
coefficient to be used shall not be less than 0.65 for use in the Rational Method or an appropriate equivalent value as approved by the County Engineer for any other method. 


2.   Roadways – The primary function of roadways within a development shall be for the conveyance of traffic.  The use of streets as a storm runoff facility shall be restricted to the requirements established and set forth in these design criteria.


3.   Onsite or on stream detention and natural drainage  ways – are recommended and encouraged where feasible.


4.  Minimum Standards of Design
                   a.   Enclosed Systems – Enclosed systems consisting of underground pipes, culverts, 
                           and similar functional underground structures shall be used to convey storm water  
                        at all locations:
      1. Where the design peak discharge of a 10 year return period storm is equal to or less than the capacity of a seventy-two inch diameter round pipe having a Manning’s “n” of .013.
      2. Within the right-of-way of improved streets, regardless of system design capacity.
      3. Within 60 feet of any existing or proposed habitable building, regardless of system design capacity.
      4. Where the design peak discharge of a 10 year return period storm equals or exceeds 8 c.f.s . and the collected drainage  is generated from more than 1 lot.
2.  Open Systems – Open systems consisting of natural and/or improved open channels with intermittent culverts or bridges crossing streets and other surfaced areas may be used to convey storm water at all locations where the use of an enclosed system is not required by the foregoing criteria.


3. Overflow Systems – Ease conveyance element of the storm water drainage  system shall include an overflow system having sufficient hydraulic capacity when combined with the capacity of the conveyance elements to convey the peak discharge generated by 100 year return period storm without damage to land or buildings, as defined as follows:
i.   One  hundred (100) year stage; plus 1 foot freeboard, at an elevation
     equal to or greater than the lowest elevation at which water may enter 
                                         any proposed or existing building or structure.
       ii.  Design Storm Frequencies – Enclosed and open channel conveyance 
system components shall be designed for the following return period storms, irrespective of the land use in which the system is located or the land use in the drainage  area tributary to the system:
iii.  In-System Capacity:
                             Floodway in 100 year Flood Plain                                100 year
                             Bridges, Pipes, and Culverts
                                           (any crossing of and/or under roads                                     50 year
                             All other system components                                  10 year
                                
iv.  Overflow Channels:
The combined capacity of the overflow channel and in system conveyance element shall be sufficient to convey the 100 year storm at all locations. 
 v.  Runoff Computation – The Rational Method of calculation storm water   
      quantities, Q + KCIA, shall be used with the following definitions of   
      terms and arbitrary values:
* Q” is the quantity of runoff in cubic feet per second and is the basis for design of the storm drainage  system.
* “K” is a dimension less coefficient to account for antecedent precipitation.
* “C” is the weighted coefficient of runoff from the tributary area and shall have the following values where applicable:
* “I” is intensity of rainfall in inches per hour and shall be determined for the yearly frequency stipulated previously and as derived from the intensity duration curves included as part of this criteria.


D.        All construction improvements shall be guaranteed in the same manner as street improvements.


Also see Technical Specifications and Design Criteria Manual and “Drainage  Easements,” Article 80.15B, and Article 110.
 
80.13  Dams and Water Impoundment Structures


A.        New Dams
New dams and water impoundment structures shall comply with the standards of Article  110.1B.


B.        Existing Dams


1. Within Minor Subdivisions 
Dams and ponds within a minor subdivision (4 or fewer lots) may be required to be inspected by the Ray County Soil and Conservation District or a registered engineer to insure stability. (not required for lots 19 acres or more) 


2. Within Major Subdivisions 
An engineering report may be requested to be submitted to the county with the Preliminary Plat on all existing dams within a proposed major subdivision (5 or more lots).  Any dam found to be structurally unsafe or inadequate to accommodate the proposed development shall be reconstructed, reinforced or removed in accordance with all applicable standards, including those of Article 100.5.  


80.14  Street Signs and Traffic Markers
The subdivider shall install street signs and other traffic control devices at all intersections within the subdivision.  Such signs shall meet the size and design standards established by the Missouri Department of Transportation. 


80.15  Easements
        
A.        Utility Easements
Where alleys are not provided, permanent easements shall be provided of not less than 7 ½ feet in width on each side of all rear and side lot lines, for utility poles, wires, conduits, underground conductors, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains, and other public utilities and a minimum of 20 feet along all front lot lines.  These easements shall provide for a continuous rightofway.  Where the utility company or agency has the need for a wider easement than required above for a specific location, this easement shall be shown on the plat.  Permanent easements shall not be obstructed by structures, retaining 
walls, ponds or trees.  A property owner may install fences and landscape over the easement with grass and shrubs at their own risk.  Property owners shall be responsible for the maintenance on their property.


B.        Drainage  Easements
If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage  way or channel, the decision-making body shall be authorized to require the provision of drainage  easements or no-build zones to protect such watercourses.  Required easements and no-build zones shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to provide adequate storm water drainage  for a 100year storm and for access for maintenance thereof.  Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.  The subdivider shall have an engineer's study prepared for review as part of the plat process.  The study shall address the required width of easements for each watercourse or drainage  way that contains flowing water for more than 90 days per year. Such study shall be based on a 100year storm, using build-out assumptions derived from the Comprehensive Plan.  Wherever possible, drainage  ways should remain open, unpaved and maintained so as not to become overgrown.


C.        Landscape Easements
Landscape easements or buffer strips may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad rightof way or limited access highway, or where lots back onto a public street.  When in residential districts, landscape easements should be at least 50 feet in depth, in addition to the normal required lot depth when provided adjacent to the railroad rightofway or limited access highway.  Landscape easements shall be a part of the platted lots and shall have the following restriction letter on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting and maintenance of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures hereon is prohibited".


D.        Topographic Preservation Easements
If greenways or drainage  ways influenced by topographical features such as streams or ponds, ravines, wooded areas or other natural features are to be provided within the  proposed plat, their width and location shall be determined as may be necessary to preserve such features.


E.        Stream Setback Easements
Any development adjacent to an existing stream shall be set back 100 feet from the center of the stream. (See Article 110.2C)


 


80.16  Monuments 
Permanent survey monuments shall be placed at all lot and block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets, and at intermediate points as required prior to final acceptance by the County.  Such permanent monuments shall be set with top of the monument flush with existing grade.  Such monuments shall be installed in accordance with minimum standards as established by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
                                                                                                                                                          


















80.18  Subdivision Guarantees


Two types of subdivision guarantees are established for the purpose of assuring proper, safe and timely installation and maintenance of required subdivision improvements: (1) performance guarantees and (2) maintenance guarantees.  Subdivision guarantees shall be required for all subdivisions, except for those with no engineered improvements.


A.        General Requirements
All restoration, performance and maintenance guarantees shall be prepared in a format acceptable to the County and shall be submitted to the County Commission.   The Treasurer of Ray County shall be the beneficiary of all subdivision guarantees.  Upon acceptance of a subdivision guarantee, the County Commission shall deposit the guarantee with the County Clerk or, in the case of a cash bond, may place it in an account with the County Treasurer.  The following forms of subdivision guarantees may be used for required restoration, performance and maintenance guarantees.


        1.        Cash Bond
A Cash Bond is an acceptable form of subdivision guarantee. The bond shall be made payable to “Treasurer, County of Ray.” Cash Bonds may be provided in the form of a cashier’s check, bank draft, certified check or bank money order.  A Certificate of Deposit is not an acceptable form of guarantee. 


        2.        Irrevocable Letter of Credit
An Irrevocable Letter of Credit is an acceptable form of subdivision guarantee provided the form and content of the documents are found acceptable to the County.


B.        Performance Guarantees


        1.        Purpose
Performance guarantees are established for the purpose of assuring that the developer properly installs all proposed subdivision improvements in accordance with the approved Construction Plans and Final Plat for the subdivision.  Should the developer fail to properly install all subdivision improvements within the term of the guarantee, the county may draw on the guarantee and use the funds to complete subdivision improvements.


The county also may draw on the performance guarantee if the developer fails to provide a maintenance guarantee to the county.  The county may use the funds to ensure proper maintenance of subdivision improvements.


        2.        Amount
The amount of the performance guarantee shall be 100 percent of the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as approved during the review of Construction Plans.
        3.        Term
The performance guarantee shall be posted as a prerequisite to recordation of the Final Plat. The guarantee shall be posted for a minimum 2-year period. However, should the end of the 2-year period fall between December 1 and June 14, the guarantee shall expire the first business day after June 14.  The County Commission, for good cause and with the approval of the provider of the guarantee, may extend the term for not more than 1 year.


        4.        Release of Development Improvement Agreement and Guarantee
The county’s final acceptance of improvements will follow the receipt of signatures of all entities accepting the constructed improvements and documentation showing that the developer owns the improvements in fee simple and that there are no liens or encumbrances on the improvements.  The county will then execute a resolution accepting the improvements and releasing the developer from the performance guarantee, after which the developer shall record such release.


C.        Maintenance Guarantees


        1.        Purpose
Maintenance guarantees may be required by the County Commission for the purpose of assuring that the developer maintains the structure, function and integrity of subdivision improvements in accordance with the approved Construction Plans and specifications for the subdivision during the term of the guarantee. In the event the developer has failed to maintain subdivision improvements within the term of the guarantee, the county may draw on such guarantees and use the funds to correct the deficiencies.


Furthermore, if at any time during the term of the maintenance guarantee the county identifies that the developer’s failure to maintain subdivision improvements has created a clear threat to the public’s health, safety and/or general welfare, the county may, after appropriate notice and demand requirements, draw on the maintenance guarantee and use the funds to correct the identified threat.


        2.        Amount
The amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be determined by the County Commission. Generally, the maintenance guarantee shall be 15 percent of the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as approved during the review of Construction Plans.  The County Commission may waive the requirement for a maintenance guarantee when it finds that the guarantee is not necessary.


        3.        Term
The maintenance guarantee shall be posted as a prerequisite to the release of the performance guarantee, unless waived by the County Commission.  The guarantee shall be posted for a period of 1 to 3 years, as deemed necessary by the County Commission.  The County Commission, for good cause and with the approval of the provider of the guarantee, may extend the term not to exceed the total maintenance period to more than 3 years.
Article 90   Perimeter Roadway Improvements
        
90.1  Authority and Purpose


Pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan, and the power vested in the County Commission to require road improvements as provided for in RSMo 64.825 , the development, subdivision or re-subdivision (involving additional lots) of land, may only be accomplished by requiring land development to bear a proportionate share of the cost of road improvements attributable to the need for such facilities generated by the proposed project to promote the public, health, safety and welfare.  It is the purpose of this Article to require developers to pay a prorata share of the cost of improving existing county roadways abutting their project to the Ray County Road Standards. The amount of road improvement fee required is included in this Article.  Developers are only responsible for the amount of additional traffic created by a project, not any traffic generated by the use on the property at the time of application.


90.2  Administration


The County Commission shall be responsible for the administration of this Article.  The County Commission shall be responsible for developing administrative procedures for  road improvement, considering changes in the land use and density, establishing standards for the improvements, and all other activities related to the intent of the program.


90.3  Applicability


The fees required by this Article shall be imposed upon all development occurring after June 10,2005.  These regulations shall not apply to any rezoning, conditional use permit, or subdivision application made prior to the date of the approval of these regulations by the County Commission. Development for the purpose of any activity requiring platting, replatting, or a building permit, where fees were not previously paid, shall be deemed eligible for payment.  Any expansion of use by more than 25 percent over the level of the original use, shall be deemed to be an expansion of such activity, and shall require the payment of fees.


90.4  Effect on Other Regulations


This Article shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, the density of development, design and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or the provision of capital improvements subject to these Zoning Regulations or other regulations of Ray County, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all development.


90.5  Improvements as Additional Requirement
All subdivisions filed under the Major Subdivision application are subject to a review of needed off-site improvements.  If, during staff review, there are concerns, a study may be ordered to assess the actual off-site impacts of the subdivision.


A.        Off-Site Improvements
        When a proposed development is projected to have off-site drainage  or traffic impacts, the subdivider may be required to complete certain off-site improvements that are intended to mitigate the effects of the increased runoff or traffic counts.  Such improvements will be supported by a Traffic Impact Study done by the applicant and included in the conditions of the Final Plat approval.  Improvements may include, but are not limited to: 
1. Streets and thoroughfare facilities
2. Traffic control facilities
3. Bridges
4. Storm drainage  facilities
5. Utility undergrounding
6. Street lighting
7. Street trees and median landscaping
8. Accel and/or decel lanes
9. Turn lanes
10. Raised medians


B.        Substitution
        The improvements required by this Article are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by Ray County on the development of land.  It is intended to be consistent with and to further the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and other county policies, ordinances, and resolutions by which the County seeks to ensure the provision of public facilities in conjunction with the development of land.


90.6  Construction of Improvements/Payment of Fees


Unless otherwise required by the County Commission, the subdivider/builder may elect to either construct the required road improvements or contribute the amount of road improvement fee outlined by this Article, but may not combine the two methods.

        2.        Expansions and Alterations
        The offstreet parking and loading standards of this Article apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged.  Additional offstreet parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use, provided that in all cases the number of offstreet parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (preexisting & expansion) must equal at least 75 percent of minimum ratio established in OffStreet Parking Schedule “A” of this Article.


        3.        Timing of Installation
Required parking spaces and drives shall be ready for use and approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to allow issuance of a certificate of occupancy before installation of required parking if the applicant provides a letter of credit, performance bond, escrow deposit or other acceptable financial security adequate to ensure that all required parking will be installed when weather conditions permit.  The amount of the financial guarantee must be equal to at least 100 percent of the estimated total cost (labor and materials).  The county shall be authorized to use such financial guarantee to complete the work if the required parking is not in place by the date stated on the approved performance guarantee.


        4.        No Reduction Below Minimums
Existing parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this Article.  Any change in use that increases applicable offstreet parking or loading requirements will be deemed a violation of these Zoning Regulations unless parking and loading spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

        3.        OffStreet Parking Schedule “C”
Schedule “C” uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single offstreet parking standard.


                a.        Parking Study
Anyone proposing to develop or expand a use requiring Schedule “C” parking must submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of offstreet parking spaces proposed.  A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use.  Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.  The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.


                b.        Review by Planning and Zoning Administrator
The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate offstreet parking standard for the proposed use.  After reviewing the parking study, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall establish a minimum offstreet parking standard for the proposed use.


                c.        Appeals
Appeals of the Planning and Zoning Administrator ’s decision may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.14


C.        Rules for Computing Requirements
        The following rules apply when computing offstreet parking and loading requirements.


        1.        Multiple Uses
Lots containing more than 1 use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.










        2.        Fractions
When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of ½ or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than ½ will be rounded up to the next higher whole number.










         3.        Area Measurements


Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-footagebased parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area, which for purposes of computing offstreet parking requirements, shall mean the gross floor area of the building measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings and shall include the following areas:
                a.        the area of each floor of the structure and
                     b.        all attic space having headroom of 7 feet-10 inches or more
               
             4.        OccupancyBased Standards
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum firerated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.


        5.        Unlisted Uses
Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an offstreet parking schedule, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall apply the offstreet parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with Off-Street Parking Schedule “C.”
































D.        Location of Required Parking
        1.        On-Site Parking; Setbacks and Buffering
Except as expressly stated in this Article, all required offstreet parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use. Unless otherwise expressly stated, off-street parking areas shall be set back at least 10 feet from all front (street right-of-way) and rear property lines.


                a.        Street Buffers
Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent street rights-of-way by principal buildings or by landscape buffer strips as follows:




Parking Area Size Number of Spaces
	Buffer Width Minimum (feet)
	Minimum Planting Requirements
	5-15
	5
	Hedgerow (shrubs planted maximum of 3 feet on center)
	16-50
	10
	1 small tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet
	51+
	20
	1 medium tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet
	Minimum sizes: shrubs = 1 gallon, small deciduous tree = 1½-inch DBH, small evergreen tree = 4½-foot height, medium deciduous tree = 2½-inch DBH, medium evergreen tree = 5½ feet height (DBH=Diameter at Breast Height)


The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit the use of existing (pre-development) vegetation as a substitute
 for landscape buffer strips if such existing vegetation will provide a visual buffer
.




  

  

        Figure 100.1-1  
  

  

                b.        Residential Buffers
Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent residential zoning districts by buildings, fences, walls or dense landscape planting screens with a minimum height of 5 feet. Preservation of existing (pre-development) vegetation is the preferred method of screening.


        2.        OffSite Parking
Offstreet parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if approved in accordance with Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the offsite parking complies with the all of following standards.


                a.        Ineligible Activities
Offsite parking may not be used to satisfy the offstreet parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenienceoriented uses.  Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located offsite.


2. Location
        No offsite parking space may be located more than 1,000 feet from the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area.  Offsite parking spaces may not be separated from the use that it serves by a street rightofway with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a gradeseparated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area.
                
               c.        Zoning Classification
Offsite parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts.  Offsite parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or nonresidential zoning districts. 


                d.        Agreement for OffSite Parking
In the event that an offsite parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement will be required.  An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning and Zoning Department.  Recordation of the agreement with the Recorder of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the offsite parking area.  An offsite parking agreement may be revoked only if all required offstreet parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this Article.


        3.        Shared Parking
Developments or uses with different operating hours or peak business periods may share offstreet parking spaces if approved in accordance with the Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the shared parking complies with the all of following standards.


                a.        Location
Shared parking spaces must be located within 1000 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.


                b.        Zoning Classification
Shared parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts.  Shared parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or nonresidential zoning districts. 


                c.        Shared Parking Study
Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying offstreet parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the Planning and Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking.  The study must be provided in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and made available to the public.  It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing offstreet parking spaces.


                d.        Agreement for Shared Parking
A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record.  An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning and Zoning Department.  Recordation of the agreement with the Recorder of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the offsite parking area.  A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required offstreet parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this Article.

Article 110  Environmental


110.1   Dams and Water Impoundment Structures


A.        General
Dams and water impoundment structures shall be planned, designed and constructed under the supervision of a structural or professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri and shall comply with all applicable county and state standards.  A preliminary engineering report, including soil investigations and design procedures, in accordance with state and county standards, may be submitted to the county prior to any development approval.  The applicant's engineer shall certify that the dam is constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.  (See Article 80.13)


B.        Dams
A dam construction permit must be obtained from the Building Official before beginning construction of any dam.  A dam construction permit shall only be granted as follows:


        1.        Dams that are proposed to be constructed on parcels of less than 20 acres in area shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri.  Prior to construction of such dam, detailed design plans shall be submitted for review by the Building Official for compliance with all applicable county and state standards.  After the construction of such dam, the engineer shall certify that the dam is built in accordance with the approved plans.


2.        Submitted plans must show the method of dam construction, the materials to be used for fill, including the specified soil types, all proposed structures for the control of excess water, and the maximum land area that the impounded water could cover.  The plan shall note the number of acres contained in the drainage area topographically higher than the lowest point of the dam.


3.        Dams that impound water from a drainage area of 20 acres or more shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri.  Prior to construction of such, detailed design plans and specifications shall be submitted to the County Engineer for design review and compliance with State of Missouri standards.  The professional engineer shall certify that the dam has been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications and State of Missouri standards.


4.        No pond or lake shall be located closer than 50 feet to any county, state or city road, street or road rightofway.


5.        No pond or lake shall impound water over a utility easement, except a drainage easement, or over an existing utility line including sewage lateral fields.  Where impounded waters will back up on to other (off-site) property, water impoundment easements shall be required and recorded.


6.        Ponds or lakes with a surface area of 1 acre or less (at normal pool level or normal spillway elevation) and used exclusively for an individual dwelling unit’s sewage retention or for agricultural purposes shall be exempt from the standards of this Article. 
C.        Retention Basins
When the development of a site will substantially increase the runoff of stormwater onto adjoining properties, the County Engineer may require that retention basins be provided onsite to control the rate of runoff.


D.        Dam Breach Studies
Decision-making bodies shall be authorized to require the preparation of a dam breach study for lakes with an area of 5 acres or more (at normal spillway elevation).  When required, breach studies shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri. 


As in the case of FIRM floodplain mapping, development shall be discouraged within the designated dam breach area.


110.2   Stormwater Management


Stormwater is water from rain or melting snow that does not soak into the ground.  It flows from rooftops, over paved areas and bare soil, and through sloped lawns.  As it flows, this runoff collects and transports soil, manure, salt, pesticides, fertilizer, oil and grease, leaves, litter and other potential pollutants.  Contaminants include: livestock waste, fuels and solvents, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers.  Contrary to popular belief, most storm sewers do not carry storm water to wastewater treatment plants.  Stormwater is unavoidable, but keeping harmful chemicals and materials out of runoff, as well as designing detention areas that would reduce the flows and, therefore, the amount of erosion can reduce its effects.  


Soil type can affect surface water contamination.  Although runoff occurs from all soil types, clay soils are more likely to cause surface water runoff because they are less permeable.  Eroding soil is considered a water pollutant.


For additional information, contact the University of Missouri Extension Service, the Ray County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Conservation, and the Ray County Health Department.


A.        Practices that will reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality in streams
                  1.    Cover bare soil with vegetable and flower gardens, grass seed, and natural prairie 
                          grass coverings.
2.     Remove all debris from ditches and creeks and from areas where they might be
        swept into a channel.
3.     Consider using materials other than concrete or asphalt for drives and walkways 
         that would allow for more seepage into the ground.
4.      Keep basement windows or doors sealed against leaks.
5.      Slope the yard away from the foundation to prevent water from pooling near the
         structure.
6.      Use downspouts to carry water from the roof onto grassy areas.
7.      Consider a landscaping layout engineered to reduce runoff.
8.      Pump and repair on-site septic systems on a regular basis.
9.      Replace septic systems if it is more than 30 years old, made of soil or 
         undersized for any additions you have made to your house.
                  10.     Do not drive vehicles on the drain field. 
11.     Do not pave, build, or pile heavy objects on a drain field.
12.     Divert roof runoff and other surface runoff away from the drain field.
13.     Do not dispose of tissues, diapers, sanitary napkins, cigarette butts and other 
          solid waste down the toilet.
14.     Paints, solvents, acids, drain cleaners, oils and pesticides can pass untreated 
          through your system and contaminate the groundwater.
15.     Consider the individual characteristics of the site when building; such as soil 
           type and depth; depth to bedrock; depth to the water table; and location of
           wetlands, streams, or other surface water.


These Zoning Regulations may require all development of more than 20 acres to submit a stormwater plan for review. 
  

B.        Stream Protection

110.6   Floodplain Management


A.        Floodplain Designations


        1.        The special flood hazard areas of unincorporated Ray County are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 


        2.          These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 


B.        Statutory Authority
The regulations of this Article are adopted pursuant to the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the State of Missouri, including the statutory authority conferred by RSMo 49.600.
  



C.        Purpose
It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:


1.        restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;


2.        require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;


3.        control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;


4.        control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage waters;


5.        prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands; and


                6.        maintain the county’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d).


D.        Objectives
        The objectives of the regulations of this Article are:


1.        to protect human life and health;


2.        to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;


3.        to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;


4.        to minimize prolonged business interruptions;


5.        to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;


6.        to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 


7.        to protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard; and


8.        to assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the county to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.


E.        Applicability
The regulations of this Article shall apply to all areas of unincorporated Ray County identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones, AE, AO, and AH Zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map dated January 19, 1983 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.  In all areas covered by this Article, no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a Floodplain Development Permit granted in accordance with the procedures and standards of this Article.


F.        Basis For Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management agency in its Flood Insurance Study, dated January 19, 1983 with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Article.


G.        Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration.  Larger 
floods can and will occur on rare occasions, and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes.  The regulations of this Article do not imply that land outside special flood hazard areas or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This Article shall not create liability on the part of the Ray County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.


H.        Interpretation
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.


I.        Compliance
No development located within known flood hazard areas of unincorporated Ray County shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.


J.        Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Article imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this Article shall prevail.

110.12   Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding


Located within the areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. 


A.        AO Zones
The standards of this sub-Article shall apply in all AO zones.


        1.        Residential
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as 2 feet above the depth number specified in feet on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).


        2.        Nonresidential
All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:


a.        Have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as 2 feet above the depth number specified in feet on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified), or


b.        Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood proofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator at the time of application for a Floodplain Development Permit.


        3.        Residential and Nonresidential
Adequate drainage  paths shall be provided around all structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
B.        AH Zones

                2.        Adequate drainage  paths shall be provided around all structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.


110.13   Standards for Floodways


Located within the areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. Floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and possible projectiles. The standards of this Article shall apply within floodways.


A.        Allowed Uses
Only uses having a low flooddamage potential and not obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the floodway. The following are recommended uses within the floodway:


        1.        Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries, forestry.
        2.        Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas.
        3.        Nonresidential areas such as loading areas, parking, airport landing strips.
        4.        Public and private recreational uses such as golf courses, archery ranges, picnic grounds, parks, wildlife and nature preserves.


B.        Encroachments
All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a professional registered engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase of flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation.


C.        Standards
Any uses or encroachments that the county allows within the floodway shall be subject to all other applicable standards of this Article.


D.        Unnumbered A Zones
In unnumbered A zones, the county shall be authorized to use any floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources.

B.        comply with the permitting, elevating and anchoring requirements for manufactured housing units and mobile homes, as set out in this Article. 
        
        For the purpose of this Article, a recreational vehicle shall be deemed ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-connect type utilities and securing devices, and has no permanently attached additions.


110.15  Floodplain Variances


A.        Procedure
Variances from the regulations and standards of this Article may be requested and granted in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.8, as modified by the provisions of this Article.


B.        Variance Criteria
In passing upon applications for variances from the provisions of this Article, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other Articles of this Article, and the following criteria:


        1.        The danger to life and property due to flood damage.


        2.        The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
        
        3.        The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.


        4.        The importance of services provided by the proposed facility to the community.


        5.        The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.


        6.                The availability of alternate locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed 
                        use.


        7.        The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.


        8.        The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for that area.


        9.        The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.


        10.        The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood 
                waters, if applicable, expected at the site.
        11.        The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, 
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.  


C.        Conditions for Approval of Variances
Generally, Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of ½ acre or less in area contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the conditions of paragraphs 1 through 5 of this sub-Article (immediately below) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond ½ acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.


1.        Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Article.


2.        Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.


3.        Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.


4.        Variances shall only be issued upon:


 a.        a showing of good and sufficient cause;


 b.        a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 


 c.        a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.


5.        Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice (over the signature of the Presiding Commissioner of the County Commission) that the cost of flood insurance will increase to as high as $25 per $100 of coverage and that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions.


110.16   Floodplain Nonconformities


A structure or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful at the time of establishment but that does not comply with the provisions of this Article may be continued, subject to the following conditions:
A.        Discontinuance and Abandonment
A nonconformity under this Article that is discontinued or remains vacant for a continuous period of 12 months, shall be presumed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure or land site must conform with all applicable provisions of this Article. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon a showing, to the satisfaction of the Floodplain Administrator that during such period, the owner of the land or structure has been:


1.        maintaining the land and structure in accordance with all applicable regulations, including the Building Code and did not intend to discontinue the use; or


2.        has been actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for sale or lease; or


3.        has been engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there was not an intent to abandon.


B.        Nuisances
Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconformity.


C.        Damage or Destruction
If any nonconformity is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is reconstructed in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Article. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.


110.17   Floodplain Violations


Violation of the provisions of this floodplain ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor.  Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent Ray County or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.


110.18 Floodplain Amendments


The regulations, restrictions and boundaries set forth in this Article may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.  All such amendments shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.2.  A copy of amendments approved will be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

120.3   Computations and Measurements


  

A.        Sign Area of Individual Signs
The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) is computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral Article of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such supporting device otherwise meets the regulations of these Zoning Regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.


B.        Area of DoubleFaced Signs  
Where the sign faces of a doublefaced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 90 degrees or less, only 1 display face shall be counted in computing sign area. If the 2 faces of a doublefaced sign are of unequal area, the area of the larger sign face shall be counted as the sign’s area.  In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign.


C.        Height
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to the highest point of the sign or sign structure, measured from the elevation of the road to which it is oriented, or, if there is no road, from the finished grade elevation beneath the sign.


D.        Wall Area
In computing the area of a wall only the first 12 feet of building height shall be used.
E.        Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Lot
The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a lot shall be computed by applying the formula set out in Table 1202, (Maximum Total Sign Area), to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as specified in the table.  Lots fronting on 2 or more streets shall be allowed the stated sign area for each street frontage.  However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.


120.4   Signs Exempt from Regulation


The following signs shall be exempt from regulation under this Article:


        A.        Any public notice or warning required by a valid and applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation.


         B.        Signs that are not oriented to or intended to be legible from a street or other private property;

Article 130  Nonconformity


130.1  General


A.        Purpose
The regulations of this Article govern uses, structures, lots and other situations that came into existence legally but that do not conform to one or more requirements of these Zoning Regulations.  It is the general policy of the county to allow uses, structures or lots that came into existence legally and in conformance with then-applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of these Zoning Regulations to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such use into compliance with the current Zoning Regulations as is reasonably possible, all subject to the regulations of this Article.  The regulations of this Article are intended to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use property but to control the expansion of nonconformity, prohibit re-establishment of abandoned nonconformity and limit re-establishment of nonconforming structures that have been substantially destroyed.


B.        Authority to Continue
Any nonconformity that legally existed on June 1, 2005 or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to these Zoning Regulations may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this Article.


C.        Determination of Nonconformity Status
The burden of establishing that a nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases be solely upon the owner of such nonconformity.


D.        Repairs and Maintenance
Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformity shall be permitted unless such repairs are otherwise expressly prohibited by these Zoning Regulations.  Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official.


E.        Change of Tenancy or Ownership
        The status of a nonconformity is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.


130.2  Nonconforming Uses


A.        Definition
A nonconforming use is a use that was legally established but which is no longer allowed by the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.


B.        Expansion
A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless one of the following conditions exists:        


1.        such expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconforming aspects of the situation
2.  the expansion is into a part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and 
        manifestly designed or arranged for such use; or


        3.        the expansion is for a living space addition to a house.


        4.        Expansion for the sole purpose of providing off-street parking shall not be considered expansion of a nonconforming use.


C.        Change of Use
A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.


D.        Loss of Legal Nonconformity Status


1. Abandonment
If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 days, the use shall be considered abandoned.  Once abandoned, the use’s legal nonconforming status shall be lost and reestablishment of the use shall be prohibited. Any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.


2. Damage or Destruction
If a nonconforming use or a structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the nonconforming use shall not be restored unless in full compliance with the provisions of these Zoning Regulations.   


If a nonconforming use or structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged by less than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the use may be re-established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, provided that such repairs, restoration or reconstruction are substantially completed within 12 months of the date of such damage.


3. Accessory Uses and Structures
No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it complies with all regulations of these Zoning Regulations.


130.3   Nonconforming Structures


A.        Definition
A nonconforming structure is any building or structure that was legally established but which no longer complies with the Density, Intensity and Dimensional Standards of Article 70.


B.        Use
A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the underlying zoning district. 
C.        Expansion
