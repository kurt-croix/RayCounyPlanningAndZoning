## 110.6 Floodplain Management

### A. Purpose
These regulations are adopted to:
1. Protect human life and health
2. Minimize property damage from flooding
3. Ensure that development does not increase flood hazards
4. Comply with National Flood Insurance Program requirements

### B. Applicability
These floodplain regulations apply to all areas of Ray County identified as flood hazard areas on Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by the [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/).

### C. Development Standards
Development in floodplain areas shall:
1. Not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations
2. Be elevated or flood-proofed as required
3. Use flood-resistant materials and construction techniques
4. Obtain all required permits before construction

## 110.7 Floodplain Definitions

**Base Flood** - The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also known as the "100-year flood").

**Floodway** - The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

**Special Flood Hazard Area** - The land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

## 110.8 Floodplain Administration and Procedures

### A. Permits Required
Development permits shall be required for all construction and development in Special Flood Hazard Areas.

### B. Review Process
Applications for development in flood hazard areas shall be reviewed to ensure compliance with floodplain management standards.

### C. Inspections
All development in flood hazard areas shall be subject to inspection to verify compliance with permit conditions and applicable standards.

## 110.9 General Flood Hazard Reduction Standards

All development in flood hazard areas shall:
1. Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
2. Use construction methods and practices that minimize flood damage
3. Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood damage

## 110.10 Residential and Nonresidential Building Floodplain Protection Standards

### A. Residential Construction
New residential construction and substantial improvement of existing residential buildings shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation.

### B. Nonresidential Construction
New nonresidential construction and substantial improvement of existing nonresidential buildings shall either:
1. Have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation, or
2. Be flood-proofed to or above the base flood elevation

## 110.11 Floodplain Standards for Manufactured Housing Units and Mobile Homes

Manufactured housing units and mobile homes shall:
1. Be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement
2. Be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage
3. Be connected to utilities and services in a manner that minimizes flood damage

## 110.12 Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding

In areas of shallow flooding, adequate drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

## 110.13 Standards for Floodways

Development in floodways is prohibited unless it can be demonstrated that the proposed development will not result in any increase in flood elevations during the base flood discharge.

## 110.14 Floodplain Standards for Recreational Vehicles

Recreational vehicles placed in flood hazard areas shall either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
2. Meet the same standards as manufactured housing units

## 110.15 Floodplain Variances

### A. Variance Criteria
Variances from floodplain requirements may be granted only if:
1. Exceptional hardship would result from strict application of the requirements
2. The variance would not result in increased flood heights or additional threats to public safety
3. The variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief

### B. Restrictions
Variances shall not be issued for development in floodways or for new construction in flood hazard areas.

## 110.16 Floodplain Nonconformities

Existing structures that do not conform to floodplain requirements may continue as nonconforming structures, subject to the limitations in [Article 130](#article-130-nonconformities).
