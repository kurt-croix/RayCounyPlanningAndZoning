## 30.7 Planned Unit Developments

A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development. PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.

### A. Overview of Procedure
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat. Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.

1. **Preapplication Conference** - Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as [Missouri Department of Conservation](https://mdc.mo.gov/), Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.

2. **Application** - A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.

3. **PUD Concept Plan** - A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.

**Figure 30.7-1: Information Required with All PUD Concept Plans**

**See: [PUD Concept Plan Requirements](tables/pud_concept_plan_requirements.md)**

## 30.8 Conditional Use Permits

The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use. The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another. The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land. Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.

### A. Application Filing
[*Application filing requirements including water supply approval, sanitary sewer approval, road district approval, MoDOT approval, legal description, site plan, and business plan*]

**Figure 30.8-1: Information Required on All Conditional Use Permit Site Plans**

**See: [Conditional Use Permit Site Plan Requirements](tables/conditional_use_permit_site_plan_requirements.md)**

### B. Approval Criteria
A Conditional Use Permit shall not be approved unless the County Commission determines, based directly upon the particular evidence presented, that all of the following conditions exist:

1. the proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the vicinity;
2. adequate access routes will be provided and designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets;
3. adequate public safety, transportation and utility facilities/services will be available to serve the subject property while maintaining adequate levels of service for existing development; and
4. the proposed use is compatible with adjacent uses in terms of scale, site design, and operating characteristics (i.e., hours of operation, traffic generation, lighting, noise, odor, dust, and other external impacts).

### C. Lapse of Approval
If a building permit for an approved Conditional Use has not been issued within 18 months of the date that the Conditional Use Permit was approved by the County Commission, the Conditional Use Permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. The time frames of this sub-Article may be extended for up to 1 year by the County Commission if an extension request is filed with the Planning and Zoning Department prior to expiration.

*Note: The CUP Lapse of Approval provisions do not apply to uses that do not require a building permit (e.g. a plant nursery).*
