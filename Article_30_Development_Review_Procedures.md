All required information must be filed with the Planning and Zoning Department at least 15 days prior to a regular meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission at which the Final Plat is to be considered.

3. **Lapse of Final Plat Approval** - The County Commission's approval of the Final Plat shall lapse and be of no further effect if the Final Plat is not recorded with the Recorder of Deeds within 1 year of the County Commission's approval.

*Note: Applicants for subdivisions are encouraged to discuss possible development site design possibilities and related issues with the Planning and Zoning Department prior to submission of any plat.*

## 30.6 Major Subdivision

A Major Subdivision refers to a reconfiguration of land that contains any zoning district other than residential, residential with four or more lots, or any residential that requires interior streets.

## 30.7 Planned Unit Developments

[*Note: Article 30.7 content was referenced as 30.8 in source document*]

## 30.8 Planned Unit Developments

A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development. PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.

### A. Overview of Procedure
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat. Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.

1. **Preapplication Conference** - Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as [Missouri Department of Conservation](https://mdc.mo.gov/), Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.

2. **Application** - A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.

3. **PUD Concept Plan** - A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.

**Figure 30.8-1: Information Required with All PUD Concept Plans**

| 1. | Name of the project, address, boundaries, date, north arrow and scale of the plan. |

| 6. | The location of steep slopes, significant stands of trees; creeks, watercourses and drainage ways, floodplains, and any environmentally sensitive features. |
| 7. | Zoning district boundaries adjacent to the site's perimeter shall be drawn and identified on the plan. |
| 8. | The full legal description of the boundaries of the property or properties to be included in the Planned Unit Development. |
| 9. | A generalized summary of land use arrangements within the PUD, showing types of uses and intensities proposed within areas of the PUD. |
| 10. | A vicinity map showing the general arrangement of streets within an area of 1,000 feet from the boundaries of the proposed Planned Unit Development. |
| 11. | Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the tract to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the tract of land and the proposed development. |
| 12. | If the PUD calls for construction over a period of years, a schedule showing the proposed time and sequence within which the applications for final approval of all Articles of the Planned Unit Development are intended to be filed shall be submitted. |
| 13. | A written statement by the applicant shall be submitted setting forth the reasons why, in his or her opinion, a Planned Unit Development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the intent of Zoning Regulations and the Comprehensive Plan. |
| 14. | A written summary of the project proposal, including the following: |
|  | Gross area of PUD |
|  | Number of dwelling units and density |
|  | Amount of nonresidential floor area and floor area ratio |
|  | Building coverage |
|  | Common open space |
|  | Natural features to be preserved |
|  | Recreation, open space and other amenities |
|  | Proposed building materials and architectural styles |

## 30.9 Conditional Use Permits

The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use. The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another. The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land. Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.

### A. Application Filing
