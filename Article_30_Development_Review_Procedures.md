# Article 30 - Development Review Procedures

## 30.1 General

### A. Authority to File Applications
Applications for development approval under these Zoning Regulations may be filed by: the property owner of record, a purchaser under a contract for sale from the record owner, or the duly authorized agent of the record property owner. County officials shall be authorized to require proof of legal authority to take the action sought.

### B. Form of Application
Applications required under this Article must be submitted on forms and in such numbers as required by the official responsible for accepting the application.

### C. Fees

**1. Application Filing Fees**
Applications must be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee established by County Commission. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by Review and or Decision-Making Bodies. See Article 160.

**2. Special Hearing Deposit**

a. Generally
Where the total time of a hearing is expected to exceed 2 hours, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a special hearing expense deposit shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the application filing fee. Special hearing deposits are to cover actual expenses. The required deposit amounts have been established by County Commission. At any point prior to the conclusion of all hearings on a matter, the County Commission may, for good cause and based on anticipated actual costs, require a deposit to exceed the amount required for applications falling in the "Other" category of "Special Hearing Deposit," as shown in the Fee Schedule of Article 160.

b. Application Review
At the time of application filing, the applicant shall state the number of witnesses and the amount of time the applicant anticipates for the presentation of all evidence to applicable review and decision-making bodies. The application must be accompanied by a list of witnesses and exhibits. The Planning and Zoning Administrator will review all applications and make a determination of whether the hearing is likely to exceed 2 hours in length. Such determination shall be based upon: (1) the information supplied in the application, (2) the expected amount of public input, and (3) the Planning and Zoning Administrator's experience with local practices. If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator that the public hearing will exceed 2 hours in length, the applicant shall be subject to the special hearing deposit provisions of this Sub-Article.

c. Deposit Required
If at any time either before the filing of the application, or prior to a final decision of the applicable decision-making body, the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that the hearings are likely to exceed 2 hours in length, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of this determination and order the applicant to post a special hearing expense deposit, which shall be held in an account by the County Treasurer in a depository established for that purpose by the County Commission. Upon the issuance of such order by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, all proceedings upon the application shall be stayed until the deposit is received by the county. After such a stay is in effect for a period of 14 calendar days and the deposit is not made with the county, the application shall be dismissed, without prejudice against re-filing of the application.

d. Escrow Account Established
There shall be an escrow account established under the supervision of the County Treasurer's Office for each case for which the applicant pays an expense deposit. The County Treasurer shall disburse payment from the escrow account upon billings supplied by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and approved by the County Commission. These billings shall reflect the actual charges incurred which will be charged against the amount on deposit in escrow. When each billing is made, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall simultaneously mail a copy of the billing to the applicant at the address listed in the application.

e. Additional Deposits
At any time that the escrow account falls below a balance of 20 percent of the initial total expense deposit, the County Treasurer shall immediately inform the Planning and Zoning Administrator, whereupon the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall write to the applicant at the address shown on the application and direct the applicant to make deposit equal to the amount of the initial expense deposit. After the Planning and Zoning Administrator make such order, all proceedings on the application shall be stayed until the county receives the additional deposit. If the additional deposit is not received within 14 calendar days of said order, or if the applicant indicates a refusal to make such additional deposit, the application shall be dismissed without prejudice against re-filing.

f. Refunds
Upon final disposition of the application or dismissal of the application, the balance of the deposit in escrow with the County Treasurer, after all expense payments are made, shall be returned to the applicant upon the applicant's written request.

### D. Complete Application
Applications that do not include required information or that are not accompanied by required fees will be returned to the applicant and no further processing of the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected. Applications will be reviewed for completeness within 10 days of filing. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is complete, the application will be processed. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with a written explanation of the application's deficiencies.

### E. Preapplication Conferences
All applicants are encouraged to schedule and attend a preapplication conference meeting with Planning and Zoning Department staff prior to submitting an application for review under this Article. The purpose of a preapplication conference is to inform the applicant of applicable procedures, submittal requirements, development standards, and other pertinent matters before the applicant finalizes the development proposal. Staff opinions presented during a preapplication meeting are informational only and do not represent a commitment on behalf of the county regarding the acceptability of the development proposal.

### F. Establishment of Processing Cycles
Officials responsible for accepting applications, after consulting with review and decision-making bodies, may promulgate processing cycles for applications. Processing cycles may establish:

1. Deadlines for receipt of complete applications;
2. Dates of regular meetings;
3. The scheduling of staff reviews and staff reports on complete applications;
4. All required steps in the application process (including public hearings, and reviews by other agencies); and
5. Required time frames for action by review and decision-making bodies.

### G. Planning and Zoning Administrator and Agency Review
In conducting required reviews, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to distribute the application and other submittals to other departments and agencies for the purpose of soliciting comments and ensuring that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements. The Technical Review Committee (TRC) may be convened to review technical aspects of applications. See Article 20.4C.

### H. Notices
All notices required under these Zoning Regulations must: (1) indicate the time and place of all scheduled public hearings; (2) describe the property involved in the application by street address, legal description or map; (3) describe the nature, scope and purpose of the proposal; and (4) indicate the location and source of additional information about the proposal.

**1. Written Notice**

a. Unless otherwise expressly stated, when the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that written notice be provided, the official responsible for accepting the application shall provide written notice by regular mail to all owners of the subject property and all property owners within 600 feet of the subject property. ([RSMo 64.863](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.863)) Written notice shall also be sent by regular mail to the City Clerk of any municipality within 1½ miles of the subject property. ([RSMo 64.830](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.830), [64.860](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.860))

b. Written notices shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing.

c. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Planning and Zoning Department with a list of the names and addresses of the owners of record of all property within 600 feet of the subject property. The ownership information shall be obtained from a licensed abstractor, title company, registered surveyor or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant. This information should be provided in electronic and printed form. Failure to notify all adjoiners may invalidate the public notice requirements and cause the application to be tabled until proper notification is completed.

**2. Published Notice**
When the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that notice be published in the newspaper, the official responsible for accepting the application shall ensure that notice is published in a newspaper of general circulation within Ray County at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing.

**3. Constructive Notice**
Minor technical deviations from specified notice requirements shall not be deemed to impair notice where there is actual notice. Written notice shall be conclusively presumed to be properly given if placed, postage prepaid, with the United States Postal Service addressed in accordance with the list provided by the applicant. When required written notices have been properly given, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the subject property shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the body hearing the matter shall determine whether there was compliance with the notice requirements of this Article.

**4. Delay in County Commission Hearing**
If there is a delay in forwarding a recommendation to the County Commission based on technical reasons, and no specific date is announced at the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing, written notice shall be sent by regular mail to all adjoiners within 600 feet at least 15 days prior to the County Commission hearing at which the application will be heard.

### I. Action by Review and Decision-Making Bodies

1. Review and decision-making bodies may take any action on an application that is consistent with the notice given, including approving the application, approving the application in modified form or denying the application. Decision-making bodies shall also be authorized to remand an application back to a review body for further consideration and recommendation.

2. Review bodies may recommend and decision-making bodies may modify or allow amendments to the application if the effect of the modifications or amendments is to allow a less intensive use or zoning district than indicated in the application or to reduce the impact of the development or to reduce the amount of land area included in the application. (See [Zoning District Hierarchy, Article 40.1](Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#402-zoning-district-hierarchy))

3. Decision-making bodies may not approve an application for a greater density of development, a more intensive use, a more intensive zoning district, reduced setbacks, more dwelling units, greater height, more access points or fewer improvements than indicated in the notice.

## 30.7 Planned Unit Developments

A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development. PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.

### A. Overview of Procedure
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat. Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.

1. **Preapplication Conference** - Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as [Missouri Department of Conservation](https://mdc.mo.gov/), Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.

2. **Application** - A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.

3. **PUD Concept Plan** - A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.

## 30.8 Conditional Use Permits

The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use. The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another. The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land. Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.

### A. Application Filing
[*Application filing requirements including water supply approval, sanitary sewer approval, road district approval, MoDOT approval, legal description, site plan, and business plan*]

**See: [Conditional Use Permit Site Plan Requirements](tables/conditional_use_permit_site_plan_requirements.md)**

### B. Approval Criteria
A Conditional Use Permit shall not be approved unless the County Commission determines, based directly upon the particular evidence presented, that all of the following conditions exist:

1. the proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the vicinity;
2. adequate access routes will be provided and designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets;
3. adequate public safety, transportation and utility facilities/services will be available to serve the subject property while maintaining adequate levels of service for existing development; and
4. the proposed use is compatible with adjacent uses in terms of scale, site design, and operating characteristics (i.e., hours of operation, traffic generation, lighting, noise, odor, dust, and other external impacts).

### C. Lapse of Approval
If a building permit for an approved Conditional Use has not been issued within 18 months of the date that the Conditional Use Permit was approved by the County Commission, the Conditional Use Permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. The time frames of this sub-Article may be extended for up to 1 year by the County Commission if an extension request is filed with the Planning and Zoning Department prior to expiration.

*Note: The CUP Lapse of Approval provisions do not apply to uses that do not require a building permit (e.g. a plant nursery).*
