# Article 30 - Development Review Procedures
## 30.1 General
### A. Authority to File Applications
Applications for development approval under these Zoning Regulations may be filed by: the property owner of record, a purchaser under a contract for sale from the record owner, or the duly authorized agent of the record property owner. County officials shall be authorized to require proof of legal authority to take the action sought.
### B. Form of Application
Applications required under this Article must be submitted on forms and in such numbers as required by the official responsible for accepting the application.
### C. Fees
#### 1. Application Filing Fees
Applications must be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee established by County Commission. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by Review and or Decision-Making Bodies. See [Article 160](Article_160_Fee_Schedule.md).
#### 2. Special Hearing Deposit
##### a. Generally
Where the total time of a hearing is expected to exceed 2 hours, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a special hearing expense deposit shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the application filing fee. Special hearing deposits are to cover actual expenses. The required deposit amounts have been established by County Commission. At any point prior to the conclusion of all hearings on a matter, the County Commission may, for good cause and based on anticipated actual costs, require a deposit to exceed the amount required for applications falling in the "Other" category of "Special Hearing Deposit," as shown in the Fee Schedule of [Article 160](Article_160_Fee_Schedule.md).
##### b. Application Review
At the time of application filing, the applicant shall state the number of witnesses and the amount of time the applicant anticipates for the presentation of all evidence to applicable review and decision-making bodies. The application must be accompanied by a list of witnesses and exhibits. The Planning and Zoning Administrator will review all applications and make a determination of whether the hearing is likely to exceed 2 hours in length. Such determination shall be based upon:
   (1) the information supplied in the application,
   (2) the expected amount of public input, and
   (3) the Planning and Zoning Administrator's experience with local practices.
If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator that the public hearing will exceed 2 hours in length, the applicant shall be subject to the special hearing deposit provisions of this Sub-Article.
##### c. Deposit Required
If at any time either before the filing of the application, or prior to a final decision of the applicable decision-making body, the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that the hearings are likely to exceed 2 hours in length, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of this determination and order the applicant to post a special hearing expense deposit, which shall be held in an account by the County Treasurer in a depository established for that purpose by the County Commission. Upon the issuance of such order by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, all proceedings upon the application shall be stayed until the deposit is received by the county. After such a stay is in effect for a period of 14 calendar days and the deposit is not made with the county, the application shall be dismissed, without prejudice against re-filing of the application.
##### d. Escrow Account Established
There shall be an escrow account established under the supervision of the County Treasurer's Office for each case for which the applicant pays an expense deposit. The County Treasurer shall disburse payment from the escrow account upon billings supplied by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and approved by the County Commission. These billings shall reflect the actual charges incurred which will be charged against the amount on deposit in escrow. When each billing is made, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall simultaneously mail a copy of the billing to the applicant at the address listed in the application.
##### e. Additional Deposits
At any time that the escrow account falls below a balance of 20 percent of the initial total expense deposit, the County Treasurer shall immediately inform the Planning and Zoning Administrator, whereupon the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall write to the applicant at the address shown on the application and direct the applicant to make deposit equal to the amount of the initial expense deposit. After the Planning and Zoning Administrator make such order, all proceedings on the application shall be stayed until the county receives the additional deposit. If the additional deposit is not received within 14 calendar days of said order, or if the applicant indicates a refusal to make such additional deposit, the application shall be dismissed without prejudice against re-filing.
##### f. Refunds
Upon final disposition of the application or dismissal of the application, the balance of the deposit in escrow with the County Treasurer, after all expense payments are made, shall be returned to the applicant upon the applicant's written request.
### D. Complete Application
Applications that do not include required information or that are not accompanied by required fees will be returned to the applicant and no further processing of the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected. Applications will be reviewed for completeness within 10 days of filing. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is complete, the application will be processed. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with a written explanation of the application's deficiencies.
### E. Preapplication Conferences
All applicants are encouraged to schedule and attend a preapplication conference meeting with Planning and Zoning Department staff prior to submitting an application for review under this Article. The purpose of a preapplication conference is to inform the applicant of applicable procedures, submittal requirements, development standards, and other pertinent matters before the applicant finalizes the development proposal. Staff opinions presented during a preapplication meeting are informational only and do not represent a commitment on behalf of the county regarding the acceptability of the development proposal.
### F. Establishment of Processing Cycles
Officials responsible for accepting applications, after consulting with review and decision-making bodies, may promulgate processing cycles for applications. Processing cycles may establish:
#### 1. Deadlines for receipt of complete applications;
#### 2. Dates of regular meetings;
#### 3. The scheduling of staff reviews and staff reports on complete applications;
#### 4. All required steps in the application process (including public hearings, and reviews by other agencies); and
#### 5. Required time frames for action by review and decision-making bodies.
### G. Planning and Zoning Administrator and Agency Review
In conducting required reviews, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to distribute the application and other submittals to other departments and agencies for the purpose of soliciting comments and ensuring that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements. The Technical Review Committee (TRC) may be convened to review technical aspects of applications. See [Article 20.4C](Article_20_Review_Decision_Making_Bodies.md#b-technical-review-committee).
### H. Notices
All notices required under these Zoning Regulations must:
(1) indicate the time and place of all scheduled public hearings;
(2) describe the property involved in the application by street address, legal description or map;
(3) describe the nature, scope and purpose of the proposal; and

([RSMo 64.863](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.863)) Written notice shall also be sent by regular mail to the City Clerk of any municipality within 1½ miles of the subject property. ([RSMo 64.830](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.830), [64.860](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.860))

The ownership information shall be obtained from a licensed abstractor, title company, registered surveyor or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant. This information should be provided in electronic and printed form. Failure to notify all adjoiners may invalidate the public notice requirements and cause the application to be tabled until proper notification is completed.
#### 2. Published Notice
When the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that notice be published in the newspaper, the official responsible for accepting the application shall ensure that notice is published in a newspaper of general circulation within Ray County at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing.
#### 3. Constructive Notice
Minor technical deviations from specified notice requirements shall not be deemed to impair notice where there is actual notice. Written notice shall be conclusively presumed to be properly given if placed, postage prepaid, with the United States Postal Service addressed in accordance with the list provided by the applicant. When required written notices have been properly given, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the subject property shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the body hearing the matter shall determine whether there was compliance with the notice requirements of this Article.
#### 4. Delay in County Commission Hearing
If there is a delay in forwarding a recommendation to the County Commission based on technical reasons, and no specific date is announced at the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing, written notice shall be sent by regular mail to all adjoiners within 600 feet at least 15 days prior to the County Commission hearing at which the application will be heard.
### I. Action by Review and Decision-Making Bodies

## 30.8 Planned Unit Developments

A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of
development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development.  PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.

### A. Overview of Procedure
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat.  Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.

#### 1. Preapplication Conference
Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as Missouri Department of Conservation, Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.  The purpose of this preapplication conference is to discuss the proposal and the applicable development review procedures.

#### 2. Application
A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.  No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. 

#### 3. PUD Concept Plan
A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.

##### a. The PUD Concept Plan is not intended to be a highly detailed site plan, but rather to provide enough information to officials to allow an accurate determination of the merits of a proposed project prior to beginning detailed planning work. Much of the information required at the Concept Plan stage can be conveyed in written form, although some generalized drawings will likely be required to comply with the following list of required information. (Figure 30.8-1)

##### b. The PUD Concept Plan is reviewed with respect to such issues as density, including the number, type, and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on surrounding areas; and the adequacy of facilities and services. The result of this review is the establishment of the basic parameters for development of the PUD. PUD Concept Plan approval establishes the maximum development “envelope” with regard to density, lot sizes, overall scale, open space, environmental protection, and other land development and service provision issues.

**Figure 30.8-1**
Information Required with All PUD Concept Plans
```
1.Name of the project, address, boundaries, date, north arrow and scale of the plan.

3. Name and address of all owners of record of all property within 600 feet of the property in question.
4. All existing lot lines, easements, and rights-of-way. Include area in acres or square feet, abutting land uses and structures.
5. The general location of all existing and proposed streets adjacent to and within the development.
6. The location of steep slopes, significant stands of trees; creeks, watercourses and drainage  ways, floodplains, and any environmentally sensitive features.
7. Zoning district boundaries adjacent to the site’s perimeter shall be drawn and identified on the plan.
8. The full legal description of the boundaries of the property or properties to be included in the Planned Unit Development.
9. A generalized summary of land use arrangements within the PUD, showing types of uses and intensities proposed within areas of the PUD.
10. A vicinity map showing the general arrangement of streets within an area of 1,000 feet from the boundaries of the proposed Planned Unit Development.
11. Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the tract to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the tract of land and the proposed development.
12. If the PUD calls for construction over a period of years, a schedule showing the proposed time and sequence within which the applications for final approval of all Articles of the Planned Unit Development are intended to be filed shall be submitted.
13. A written statement by the applicant shall be submitted setting forth the reasons why, in his or her opinion, a Planned Unit Development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the intent of Zoning Regulations and the Comprehensive Plan.
14. A written summary of the project proposal, including the following:
  Gross area of PUD
  Number of dwelling units and density
  Amount of nonresidential floor area and floor area ratio
  Building coverage

##### e. Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Concept Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Concept Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.

##### f. Review and Action—County Commission
After receiving the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the County Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposed PUD Concept Plan. If the County Commission acts to approve the PUD Concept Plan, it shall establish required time frames for development of the entire PUD and its individual phases, if any.

##### g. PUD Concept Plan Review Criteria
Applications for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be approved if the County Commission determines that the following criteria are met:
###### 1) The PUD Concept Plan complies with the PUD standards of Figure 30.8-1;
###### 2) The county and other agencies will be able to provide necessary public services, facilities, and programs to serve the development proposed, at the time the property is developed;
###### 3) The development is consistent with and implements the planning goals and objectives contained in Comprehensive Plan and other adopted policy documents;
###### 4) The PUD Concept Plan is consistent with sound planning practice and the development will promote the general welfare of the county;
###### 5) A PUD is necessary to address a unique situation or represents a substantial benefit to the county, compared to what could have been accomplished through strict application of otherwise applicable base zoning district standards; and
###### 6) The same development could not be accomplished through the use of other techniques, such as rezoning to a non-PUD district or Variances.

##### h. Effect of PUD Concept Plan Approval
Approval of a PUD Concept Plan shall constitute acceptance of the overall planning concepts for the proposed PUD development and is a prerequisite for the filing of a PUD Final Plan and approval of a PUD zoning classification.

##### i. Lapse of PUD Concept Plan Approval
An approved PUD Concept Plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a PUD Final Plan for the PUD (or a phase of the PUD) has not been approved within 2 years of the date of approval by the County Commission of the PUD Concept Plan. In the event of such lapse, the PUD zoning classification shall be of no effect, and the property shall be developed solely in accordance with the underlying zoning classification.  In the event of lapse of approval pursuant to this Article, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall initiate action to remove the land from the PUD overlay zoning district and may initiate action to rezone the property to its former base zoning district classification.

#### 4. PUD Zoning District Map Amendment
After approval of a PUD Concept Plan, or concurrently with the processing of a PUD Concept Plan, a Zoning District Map amendment request for PUD zoning may be reviewed and approved. PUD zoning requests shall be processed in accordance with the Zoning District Map amendment procedures of Article 30.3.

#### 5.	PUD Final Plan
The PUD Final Plan is the document upon which building permits and other applicable approvals are issued.  The PUD Final Plan review stage is the point at which developers bring forward detailed plans for carrying out the type of project conceptually approved during PUD Concept Plan review.  The applicant must submit the detailed and technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards, requirements, and conditions have been met. 

##### a. Application
After approval of a PUD zoning classification and before lapse of a PUD Concept Plan, a complete application for PUD Final Plan approval must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. A PUD Final Plan application may include the entire area covered in the PUD Concept Plan or it may include one or more phases of the approved PUD Concept Plan. The final PUD plan shall include the same information as required with a Preliminary Subdivision Plat (see Figure 30.6-1).

##### b. Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator
The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Final Plan application in light of the approved PUD Concept Plan and all other applicable development standards and planning policies.

##### c. Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Final Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Final Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.

##### d. Review and Action—County Commission
The County Commission shall consider the PUD Final Plan application and act to approve or deny the PUD Final Plan application.

##### e. PUD Final Plan Review Criteria
A PUD Final Plan shall be approved by the County Commission if it is determined by the County Commission to be in substantial compliance with the approved PUD Concept Plan.  The PUD Final Plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the PUD Concept Plan so long as, when compared with the PUD Concept Plan, it does not result in:
###### 1)         An increase in project density or intensity, including the number of housing units per acre or the amount of nonresidential floor area per acre;
###### 2)         A change in the mix of housing types or the amount of land area devoted to nonresidential uses;
###### 3)         A reduction in the amount of open space;
###### 4)         Any change to the vehicular system which results in a significant change in the amount or location of streets, parking areas, or access to the PUD;

concurrently, at the option of the applicant.

##### b. A note shall be included on the Final Plat stating:
[Example:] “Rezoned to Residential (R-1, R-3) Zoning District with a Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlay.”

##### c. A Final Plat shall be recorded for each phase of the plan after the infrastructure to be built by the developer has been constructed and approved, or adequate bonding or letter of credit submitted to the County.

## 30.9 Conditional Use Permits
The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use.  The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another.
