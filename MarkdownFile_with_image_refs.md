1.  **Special Hearing Deposit**

a. Generally

Where the total time of a hearing is expected to exceed 2 hours, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a special hearing expense deposit shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the application filing fee. Special hearing deposits are to cover actual expenses. The required deposit amounts have been established by County Commission. At any point prior to the conclusion of all hearings on a matter, the County Commission may, for good cause and based on anticipated actual costs, require a deposit to exceed the amount required for applications falling in the “Other” category of “Special Hearing Deposit,” as shown in the Fee Schedule of Article 160.

b. Application Review

At the time of application filing, the applicant shall state the number of witnesses and the amount of time the applicant anticipates for the presentation of all evidence to applicable review and decision-making bodies. The application must be accompanied by a list of witnesses and exhibits. The Planning and Zoning Administrator will review all applications and make a determination of whether the hearing is likely to exceed 2 hours in length. Such determination shall be based upon: (1) the information supplied in the application, (2) the expected amount of public input, and (3) the Planning and Zoning Administrator’s experience with local practices. If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator that the public hearing will exceed 2 hours in length, the applicant shall be subject to the special hearing deposit provisions of this Sub-Article.

c. Deposit Required

If at any time either before the filing of the application, or prior to a final decision of the applicable decision-making body, the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that the hearings are likely to exceed 2 hours in length, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of this determination and order the applicant to post a special hearing expense deposit, which shall be held in an account by the County Treasurer in a depository established for that purpose by the County Commission. Upon the issuance of such order by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, all proceedings upon the application shall be stayed until the deposit is received by the county. After such a stay is in effect for a period of 14 calendar days and the deposit is not made with the county, the application shall be dismissed, without prejudice against re-filing of the application.

d. Escrow Account Established

There shall be an escrow account established under the supervision of the County Treasurer's Office for each case for which the applicant pays an expense deposit. The County Treasurer shall disburse payment from the escrow account upon billings supplied by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and approved by the County Commission. These billings shall reflect the actual charges incurred which will be charged against the amount on deposit in escrow.

**30.8 Planned Unit Developments**

A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of

development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development. PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.

**A. Overview of Procedure**

PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat. Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.

**1\. Preapplication Conference**

Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as Missouri Department of Conservation, Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies. The purpose of this preapplication conference is to discuss the proposal and the applicable development review procedures.

**2.** **Application**

A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid.

**3\. PUD Concept Plan**

A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.

a. The PUD Concept Plan is not intended to be a highly detailed site plan, but rather to

provide enough information to officials to allow an accurate determination of the merits of a proposed project prior to beginning detailed planning work. Much of the information required at the Concept Plan stage can be conveyed in written form, although some generalized drawings will likely be required to comply with the following list of required information. (Figure 30.8-1)

b. The PUD Concept Plan is reviewed with respect to such issues as density, including the number, type, and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on surrounding areas; and the adequacy of facilities and services. The result of this review is the establishment of the basic parameters for development of the PUD. PUD Concept Plan approval establishes the maximum development “envelope” with regard to density, lot sizes, overall scale, open space, environmental protection, and other land development and service provision issues.

**Figure** **30.8-1**

**Information Required with All PUD Concept Plans**

| 1. | Name of the project, address, boundaries, date, north arrow and scale of the plan. |

| 7. | Zoning district boundaries adjacent to the site’s perimeter shall be drawn and identified on the plan. |
| 8. | The full legal description of the boundaries of the property or properties to be included in the Planned Unit Development. |
| 9. | A generalized summary of land use arrangements within the PUD, showing types of uses and intensities proposed within areas of the PUD. |
| 10. | A vicinity map showing the general arrangement of streets within an area of 1,000 feet from the boundaries of the proposed Planned Unit Development. |
| 11. | Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the tract to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the tract of land and the proposed development. |
| 12. | If the PUD calls for construction over a period of years, a schedule showing the proposed time and sequence within which the applications for final approval of all Articles of the Planned Unit Development are intended to be filed shall be submitted. |
| 13. | A written statement by the applicant shall be submitted setting forth the reasons why, in his or her opinion, a Planned Unit Development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the intent of Zoning Regulations and the Comprehensive Plan. |
| 14. | A written summary of the project proposal, including the following: |
|  | Gross area of PUD |
|  | Number of dwelling units and density |
|  | Amount of nonresidential floor area and floor area ratio |

After receiving the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the County Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposed PUD Concept Plan. If the County Commission acts to approve the PUD Concept Plan, it shall establish required time frames for development of the entire PUD and its individual phases, if any.

g. PUD Concept Plan Review Criteria

Applications for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be approved if the County Commission determines that the following criteria are met:

1) The PUD Concept Plan complies with the PUD standards of Figure 30.8-1;

2) The county and other agencies will be able to provide necessary public services, facilities, and programs to serve the development proposed, at the time the property is developed;

3) The development is consistent with and implements the planning goals and

objectives contained in _Comprehensive Plan_ and other adopted policy

documents;

4) The PUD Concept Plan is consistent with sound planning practice and the development will promote the general welfare of the county; and

5) A PUD is necessary to address a unique situation or represents a substantial

benefit to the county, compared to what could have been accomplished through

strict application of otherwise applicable base zoning district standards; and

1.  The same development could not be accomplished through the use of other

techniques, such as rezoning to a non-PUD district or Variances.

h. Effect of PUD Concept Plan Approval

Approval of a PUD Concept Plan shall constitute acceptance of the overall planning concepts for the proposed PUD development and is a prerequisite for the filing of a PUD Final Plan and approval of a PUD zoning classification.

i. Lapse of PUD Concept Plan Approval

An approved PUD Concept Plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a PUD Final Plan for the PUD (or a phase of the PUD) has not been approved within 2 years of the date of approval by the County Commission of the PUD Concept Plan. In the event of such lapse, the PUD zoning classification shall be of no effect, and the property shall be developed solely in accordance with the underlying zoning classification. In the event of lapse of approval pursuant to this Article, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall initiate action to remove the land from the PUD overlay zoning district and may initiate action to rezone the property to its former base zoning district classification.

**4\. PUD Zoning District Map Amendment**

After approval of a PUD Concept Plan, or concurrently with the processing of a PUD Concept Plan, a Zoning District Map amendment request for PUD zoning may be reviewed and approved. PUD zoning requests shall be processed in accordance with the Zoning District Map amendment procedures of Article 30.3.

**5\. PUD Final Plan**

The PUD Final Plan is the document upon which building permits and other applicable approvals are issued. The PUD Final Plan review stage is the point at which developers bring forward detailed plans for carrying out the type of project conceptually approved during PUD Concept Plan review. The applicant must submit the detailed and technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards, requirements, and conditions have been met.

a. Application

After approval of a PUD zoning classification and before lapse of a PUD Concept Plan, a complete application for PUD Final Plan approval must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. A PUD Final Plan application may include the entire area covered in the PUD Concept Plan or it may include one or more phases of the approved PUD Concept Plan. The final PUD plan shall include the same information as required with a Preliminary Subdivision Plat (see Figure 30.6-1).

b. Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator

The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews­ the PUD Final Plan application in light of the approved PUD Concept Plan and all other applicable development standards and planning policies.

c. Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission

The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Final Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the ­Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Final Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and pro­ceedings to the County Commission.

d. Review and Action—County Commission

The County Commission shall consider the PUD Final Plan application and act to approve or deny the PUD Final Plan application.

e. PUD Final Plan Review Criteria

A PUD Final Plan shall be approved by the County Commission if it is determined by the County Commission to be in substantial compliance with the approved PUD Concept Plan. The PUD Final Plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the PUD Concept Plan so long as, when compared with the PUD Concept Plan, it does not result in:

1) An increase in project density or intensity, including the number of housing

units per acre or the amount of nonresidential floor area per acre;

2) A change in the mix of housing types or the amount of land area devoted to

nonresidential uses;

3) A reduction in the amount of open space;

4) Any change to the vehicular system which results in a significant change in the amount or location of streets, parking areas, or access to the PUD;

5) Any change within 50 feet of any residential zoning district;

6) Any change determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission to

represent an increase in development intensity; or

7). A substantial change in the layout of buildings.

**6\. Final Plats**

To complete the platting process, the applicant need only to submit and record a Final Plat for the phase(s) under development in accordance with Figure 30.6-2.

a. The PUD Final Plan and the Final Plat for the first phase(s) may be reviewed

concurrently, at the option of the applicant.

_\[Example:\]_ “Rezoned to Residential (R-1, R-3) Zoning District with a Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlay.”

c. A Final Plat shall be recorded for each phase of the plan after the infrastructure to be built by the developer has been constructed and approved, or adequate bonding or letter of credit submitted to the County.

**30.9 Conditional Use Permits**

The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use. The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another. The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land. Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.

4.  the proposed use is compatible with adjacent uses in terms of scale, site design, and operating characteristics (i.e., hours of operation, traffic generation, lighting, noise, odor, dust, and other external impacts).
5.  **Conditions of Approval**

In acting to approve a Conditional Use Permit, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the County Commission may approve conditions deemed necessary to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of these Zoning Regulations, so long as the condition relates to a situation created or aggravated by the proposed use and is roughly proportional to its impact. Such conditions may include site design requirements and time limitations on the Conditional Use Permit.

The CUP Lapse of Approval provisions do not apply to uses that do not require a building permit. (e.g. a plant nursery)

1.  **Lapse of Approval**

If a building permit for an approved Conditional Use has not been issued within 18 months of the date that the Conditional Use Permit was approved by the County Commission, the Conditional Use Permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. The time frames of this sub-Article may be extended for up to 1 year by the County Commission if an extension request is filed with the Planning and Zoning Department prior to expiration of the Conditional Use Permit. (See also, Conditional Use Permit Revocation, Article 140.4F)

a. If the County Commission denies an application for a Conditional Use Permit, an application for the same or more intensive use shall not be accepted for 6 months from the date that the County Commission acted to deny the amendment.

b. If the County Commission denies a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in the I-1 or I-2 zoning districts, an application for the same or more intensive use on the subject parcel, whether the parcel is in its original configuration or expanded or reduced in area, shall not be accepted for 5 years from the date of the County Commission’s action to deny the Conditional Use Permit.

1) The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit a re-filing of a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning after 6 months if the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines, based on clear and convincing evidence provided by the applicant, that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the County Commission denied the rezoning which is the result of new facts that were not discoverable by the applicant during the previous proceedings with the use of reasonable diligence or as a result of material facts which have arisen since the previous decision. Such showings must be made prior to acceptance of the application.

2) The decision of the Planning and Zoning Administrator on a request to re-file a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning must be provided in writing and forwarded to the applicant with a copy of the decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission within 30 days of the submission of an application.

Code, including the sign regulations of Article 120;

b. the Sign Plan is consistent with any approved or concurrently proposed PUD, subdivision or site plan for the site.

**3\. Staff Review and Action**

The Building Official shall review each proposed Sign Permit application for the purpose of determining whether the proposed sign complies with all applicable sign regulations of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable. Based on that review, the Building Official shall:

a. Issue the Sign Permit, if the sign complies in every respect with the standards of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable; or

b. Deny the sign permit if the sign fails in any way to comply with the standards of Article 120 or the applicable Sign Plan.

a. the requested Variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;

b. the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;

c. the strict application of the provisions of which the Variance is requested will constitute a practical difficulty because the property cannot be used for an otherwise permitted use without coming into conflict with applicable site development standards; and

b. the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;

c. the strict application of the provisions of which a Variance is requested will constitute an unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application; and

d. the Variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare, nor destroy the intent of the _Comprehensive Plan_.

**3\. Conditions of Approval**

In acting to approve a Variance, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of these Zoning Regulations, so long as the condition relates to a situation created or aggravated by the proposed use and is roughly proportional to its impact.

**40.2 Zoning District Hierarchy**

References in these Zoning Regulations to less restrictive or more restrictive zoning districts are references to the “intensity” of development allowed, not necessarily the range of uses permitted. Under the hierarchy established by these Zoning Regulations, the R-A district is the most restrictive base-zoning district, while the I-2 district is the least restrictive base-zoning district. Overlay and Special Purpose zoning districts are not included in the zoning district hierarchy.

**40.3** **R-A Agricultural District**

**A. Description**

The agricultural district (R-A) is primarily intended to help retain large tracts of land for agricultural and open space purposes and to minimize conflicts between agricultural uses and adjacent development. It is possible that parts of this district will change to more intense urban zoning districts as utility services are extended. Minimum lot area in R-A zoning shall be 19 acres, and shall have one single family residence.

**B. Use Regulations**

The following table shows which uses are allowed in the R-A district. For a summary of uses allowed in all zoning districts, see Article 60.1. (P = Permitted by-right; C= Allowed only if reviewed and approved as a Conditional Use (See Article 30.9)

premises of the owner thereof, except under the supervision of the county sheriff. Disposal of diseased animals shall be under the direction of a veterinarian.

**F. Antennas and Towers (Amateur)**

Amateur antennas and towers are permitted in R-A and R-1, and may be approved through applying for a Conditional Use Permit in R-1A and R-1B zones. These antenna are specific to recreational transmission such as “Ham Radios,” with evidence of federal licenses and permits, and may not be used for commercial purposes.

**G. Antennas and Towers (Commercial)**

**1.** **Federal Requirements**

All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency or department of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. These regulations shall also include radio frequency emissions. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by these Zoning Regulations shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 6 months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense, in accordance with this Article.

**2\. Abandoned Towers**

Any tower that is no longer in use for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense. Should this installation remain unused for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, then it shall be deemed abandoned, and the owner shall be notified that the tower will be demolished at the cost of the owner, by order of the County Commission. A bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other form of surety acceptable to the county, shall be kept on file with the County Clerk's office equal to an amount of a binding bid for the demolition of the proposed tower structure, if the county deems the tower abandoned by the owner. Such binding bid and corresponding surety shall be updated every 5 years. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations.

**3\. Location on County Property**

Antenna supports or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the County Commission shall require a conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of this Article. The placement of antennas on existing supports or towers shall be approved by the County Commission and may be exempt from the provisions of this Article. However, this shall not be construed to eliminate the requisite building permit.

1.  **Inspection**

At least every 24 months, and at other times deemed reasonable and necessary by the Planning and Zoning Department, the tower shall be inspected by a structural engineer

registered in the State of Missouri, who is regularly involved in the maintenance, inspection and/or erection of communication towers. At a minimum, this inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the tower inspection check list provided in the Electronics Industries Association (EIA) Standard 222, "Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Support Structures." A copy of such inspection record shall be provided to the county.

**5\. Accessory Equipment Storage**

Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the communication tower, unless repairs or necessary maintenance are being made to the tower.

**6\. Fences**

Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than 6 feet in height, maintain a locked gate, and be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. Signs shall also be posted on each outward face of the fence indicating "No Trespassing," "High Voltage" and any other pertinent information.

**7\. Design and Construction**

A building permit shall be issued for the construction of a tower, and meet all requirements of the county's building codes. All plans and specifications shall be from a professional engineer, registered in the State of Missouri experienced in the design and/or analysis of communication towers. Facilities should be architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and land uses in the zone district or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.

**8\. Lighting**

Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the County Commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

**9\. Landscaping**

Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 4 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. The landscaping may be placed outside of the fenced complex on the landowner's property through the use of a landscape easement, granted to the tower owner from the property owner, to maintain the landscaping.

**10\. Co-location**

Unless otherwise exempted in this Article, all towers shall be constructed for a capacity

of 3 times the intended use in order that secondary users may lease the balance of the

tower capacity at a fair market rate. Proof must be presented to the county that there

are no other suitable sites within a 1-mile radius of the proposed tower site. To

encourage co-location, the following table establishes the minimum number of users on

a tower based on its height:

| Height (feet) | Minimum Number of Users |
| --- | --- |
| 0–80 | 1 |
| 80–120 | 2 |
| Over 120 | 3 |

The county shall be notified by letter of all additional users of the tower and related facilities. This letter shall also include an engineering certification that additional equipment was properly installed. Public safety and emergency agencies shall, if technologically feasible, be allowed to co-locate on the tower without charge.

**11\. Accessory/Principal Uses**

Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different

existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of

an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation

of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not

limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such

requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or

towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.

Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the

provisions of these Zoning Regulations shall not be deemed to constitute the

expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. Accessory uses shall include only

such buildings and facilities necessary for transmission functions and satellite ground

stations associated with them, but shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicle

storage area, nor other similar uses not necessary for the transmission function.

1.  **Separation from Existing Towers**

| New Towers | Existing Towers |
| --- | --- |
| Lattice | Guyed | Monopole |
| Lattice | 5,000 feet | 5,000 feet | 1,500 feet |
| Guyed | 5,000 feet | 5,000 feet | 1,500 feet |
| Monopole | 1,500 feet | 1,500 feet | 1,500 feet |

The County Commission may, upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, grant a deviation from the setback and separation standards. In support of a deviation request from the separation requirements, the applicant shall submit a technical study acceptable to the county, which confirms that there are no other suitable sites available within the separation requirements.

**70.2 Measurements, Computations and Exceptions**

**A. Density**

Density refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land area. Density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units on a site by the gross area (in acres) of the site on which the dwelling units are located. The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards will be met. The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a justification for adjusting other dimensional or development standards.

**B. Lot Area**

Lot area refers to the horizontal land area within lot lines. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of these Zoning Regulations except in the following cases:

2\. Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot area standards.

**C. Lot Width**

![Diagram 01](images/diagram_01.png)

Lot width is measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the front lot line or its chord and located the minimum front setback distance from the front lot line.

![Diagram 02](images/diagram_02.png)

D. Lot Depth

Lot depth is measured from the center (mid-point) of the front lot line to the center (mid-point) of the rear lot line.

**E. Setbacks**

Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this Article. Setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this Article.

**1\. Exceptions to Setbacks**

**Article 80 Subdivision Design and Improvements**

**80.1 General**

**A. Applicability**

The standards of this Article shall apply to all subdivisions of land unless otherwise expressly exempted.

**B. Technical Specifications and Design Criteria**

Standards and specifications for public improvements and technical subdivision design standards are addressed in the Ray County Road Standard. Compliance with the standards of the Ray County Road Standard shall be required on all publicly dedicated rights-of-way.

**C. Exemptions**

The standards of this Article shall not apply to the following subdivisions:

1\. A transaction between owners of adjoining unplatted property which involves only a change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons provided no additional tracts are created and such tracts comply with the lot size and setback standards of the underlying zoning district.

2\. Property which is created by adjoining unplatted tracts which involves the combination of contiguous parcels of land into one larger parcel.

3\. The conveyance of land for street or railroad right‑of‑way, utility or drainage easements, or other public utility purposes subject to local, state, or federal regulations, and where no new street or access easements are created.

4\. The conveyance of land for public recreation, trails or similar easements and public purposes.

1.  The division of land into tracts 40 acres or larger in area after the date of

adoption of this Article, provided such tracts have at least 100 total feet of frontage along a state or county-maintained roadway, and access to the tracts and any remnant parcels comply with state minimum sight distance requirements.

The exemption for cemetery plots exempts those creating individual subdivision plots from the subdivision process. It does not exempt those creating a cemetery.

8\. The division of land into cemetery plots, provided that such

division complies with RSMo 214.

9\. The division of land by any court action pursuant to the law of

eminent domain.

**80.2 Layout and Design**

**A. Compliance with Plans and Regulations**

The design of subdivisions shall be consistent with:

1\. The _Comprehensive Plan_ and all other adopted plans and policies of the County Commission; and

2\. The requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located and all other applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations.

**B. Traffic Movement and Pedestrian Circulation**

1\. The design of subdivisions should create an integrated system of lots, streets,

trails, and infrastructure that provides for efficient movement of people,

bicycles, and automobiles within the subdivision and to and from adjacent

development.

2\. All subdivisions should provide for the efficient movement of through traffic by providing a completely interconnected hierarchy of streets in order to avoid isolation of residential areas and over-reliance on arterial streets.

3\. Subdivisions should be designed to provide safe and attractive pedestrian routes to nearby commercial centers, employment, recreation, and other uses.

1.  Street layouts should be uncomplicated, so that emergency services, public

services, and visitors can find their way to their destinations.

1.  The proliferation of individual driveways on state and county roads should be

Avoided. Homeowners are responsible for all maintenance of driveway easements. Specific address signage may be required.

6\. Residential subdivisions involving 5 or more lots should be served by internal street systems rather than relying on the state and county roads for direct access to all lots, unless exempted by the Ray County Road and Bridge or the state regulating

authority. If the decision-making body allows direct residential driveway access to state or county roads, the decision-making body shall be authorized to require shared access drives and other mitigation measures to reduce the number of access points on to state and county roads and thereby promote public safety and efficient movement of traffic.

**C. Streetscape Appearance**

1.  Lot and street designs should be designed to avoid extended distances of back yard frontage on arterial streets, and where that cannot be avoided, buffering of back yards from those streets should be landscaped with buffers and fences.

2\. Edges of subdivisions should include adequate landscaping and buffering to improve the image of the area, and to protect future residents of the subdivision and adjacent developments from adverse impacts caused by significant differences in use, development intensity, or development height.

3\. Lots and streets should not be designed to require significant numbers of adjacent dwelling units with front-loaded garages that dominate the streetscape.

**D. Open Spaces**

1\. Open spaces should be integrated into and throughout the subdivision, should be connected with each other and with open spaces in adjacent development.

2\. Open spaces anticipated for use as active or developed parks should be located on relatively flat, well-drained terrain.

3\. Open spaces not anticipated for use as active or developed parks should be located on prominent high points with significant views, or along significant and interesting geological features or wooded areas, or along significant drainage.

4\. Subdivisions should be designed and laid out in a manner that creates the least damage to the natural environment, avoids to the maximum extent feasible, significant natural resources such as prime agricultural lands, wooded areas and wetlands.

**E. Specifications and Standards Generally**

1\. All public improvements shall be constructed in compliance with the standards and specifications established by this Article, the County Code and adopted regulations, including all design standards and requirements set forth .

2\. No subdivider shall be relieved of the duty to construct public improvements for the subdivision until all public improvements are constructed, approved and accepted by the county. This may be accomplished by an irrevocable letter of credit, cash escrow, performance bond, or other financial improvement guarantee acceptable to the County.

Where the utility company or agency has the need for a wider easement than required above for a specific location, this easement shall be shown on the plat. Permanent easements shall not be obstructed by structures, retaining

walls, ponds or trees. A property owner may install fences and landscape over the easement with grass and shrubs at their own risk. Property owners shall be responsible for the maintenance on their property.

**B. Drainage Easements**

If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel, the decision-making body shall be authorized to require the provision of drainage easements or no-build zones to protect such watercourses. Required easements and no-build zones shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to provide adequate storm water drainage for a 100‑year storm and for access for maintenance thereof. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. The subdivider shall have an engineer's study prepared for review as part of the plat process. The study shall address the required width of easements for each watercourse or drainage way that contains flowing water for more than 90 days per year. Such study shall be based on a 100‑year storm, using build-out assumptions derived from the _Comprehensive Plan._ Wherever possible, drainage ways should remain open, unpaved and maintained so as not to become overgrown.

**C. Landscape Easements**

Landscape easements or buffer strips may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right‑of ‑way or limited access highway, or where lots back onto a public street. When in residential districts, landscape easements should be at least 50 feet in depth, in addition to the normal required lot depth when provided adjacent to the railroad right‑of‑way or limited access highway. Landscape easements shall be a part of the platted lots and shall have the following restriction letter on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting and maintenance of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures hereon is prohibited".

**D. Topographic Preservation Easements**

If greenways or drainage ways influenced by topographical features such as streams or ponds, ravines, wooded areas or other natural features are to be provided within the proposed plat, their width and location shall be determined as may be necessary to preserve such features.

Such monuments shall be installed in accordance with minimum standards as established by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

**80.18 Subdivision Guarantees**

Two types of subdivision guarantees are established for the purpose of assuring proper, safe and timely installation and maintenance of required subdivision improvements: (1) performance guarantees and (2) maintenance guarantees. Subdivision guarantees shall be required for all subdivisions, except for those with no engineered improvements.

**A. General Requirements**

All restoration, performance and maintenance guarantees shall be prepared in a format acceptable to the County and shall be submitted to the County Commission. The Treasurer of Ray County shall be the beneficiary of all subdivision guarantees. Upon acceptance of a subdivision guarantee, the County Commission shall deposit the guarantee with the County Clerk or, in the case of a cash bond, may place it in an account with the County Treasurer. The following forms of subdivision guarantees may be used for required restoration, performance and maintenance guarantees.

**1\. Cash Bond**

A Cash Bond is an acceptable form of subdivision guarantee. The bond shall be made payable to “Treasurer, County of Ray.” Cash Bonds may be provided in the form of a cashier’s check, bank draft, certified check or bank money order. A Certificate of Deposit is not an acceptable form of guarantee.

**2\. Irrevocable Letter of Credit**

An Irrevocable Letter of Credit is an acceptable form of subdivision guarantee provided the form and content of the documents are found acceptable to the County.

**B. Performance Guarantees**

**1\. Purpose**

Performance guarantees are established for the purpose of assuring that the developer properly installs all proposed subdivision improvements in accordance with the approved Construction Plans and Final Plat for the subdivision. Should the developer fail to properly install all subdivision improvements within the term of the guarantee, the county may draw on the guarantee and use the funds to complete subdivision improvements.

The county also may draw on the performance guarantee if the developer fails to provide a maintenance guarantee to the county. The county may use the funds to ensure proper maintenance of subdivision improvements.

**2.** **Amount**

The amount of the performance guarantee shall be 100 percent of the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as approved during the review of Construction Plans.

**3\. Term**

The performance guarantee shall be posted as a prerequisite to recordation of the Final Plat. The guarantee shall be posted for a minimum 2-year period. However, should the end of the 2-year period fall between December 1 and June 14, the guarantee shall expire the first business day after June 14. The County Commission, for good cause and with the approval of the provider of the guarantee, may extend the term for not more than 1 year.

**4\. Release of Development Improvement Agreement and Guarantee**

The county’s final acceptance of improvements will follow the receipt of signatures of all entities accepting the constructed improvements and documentation showing that the developer owns the improvements in fee simple and that there are no liens or encumbrances on the improvements. The county will then execute a resolution accepting the improvements and releasing the developer from the performance guarantee, after which the developer shall record such release.

**C. Maintenance Guarantees**

**1\. Purpose**

Maintenance guarantees may be required by the County Commission for the purpose of assuring that the developer maintains the structure, function and integrity of subdivision improvements in accordance with the approved Construction Plans and specifications for the subdivision during the term of the guarantee. In the event the developer has failed to maintain subdivision improvements within the term of the guarantee, the county may draw on such guarantees and use the funds to correct the deficiencies.

Furthermore, if at any time during the term of the maintenance guarantee the county identifies that the developer’s failure to maintain subdivision improvements has created a clear threat to the public’s health, safety and/or general welfare, the county may, after appropriate notice and demand requirements, draw on the maintenance guarantee and use the funds to correct the identified threat.

**2\. Amount**

The amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be determined by the County Commission. Generally, the maintenance guarantee shall be 15 percent of the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as approved during the review of Construction Plans. The County Commission may waive the requirement for a maintenance guarantee when it finds that the guarantee is not necessary.

**3\. Term**

The maintenance guarantee shall be posted as a prerequisite to the release of the performance guarantee, unless waived by the County Commission. The guarantee shall be posted for a period of 1 to 3 years, as deemed necessary by the County Commission. The County Commission, for good cause and with the approval of the provider of the guarantee, may extend the term not to exceed the total maintenance period to more than 3 years.

**Article 90** **Perimeter Roadway Improvements**

**90.1 Authority and Purpose**

Pursuant to the _Comprehensive Plan_, and the power vested in the County Commission to require road improvements as provided for in RSMo 64.825 , the development, subdivision or re-subdivision (involving additional lots) of land, may only be accomplished by requiring land development to bear a proportionate share of the cost of road improvements attributable to the need for such facilities generated by the proposed project to promote the public, health, safety and welfare. It is the purpose of this Article to require developers to pay a pro‑rata share of the cost of improving existing county roadways abutting their project to the Ray County Road Standards. The amount of road improvement fee required is included in this Article. Developers are only responsible for the amount of additional traffic created by a project, not any traffic generated by the use on the property at the time of application.

**90.2 Administration**

The County Commission shall be responsible for the administration of this Article. The County Commission shall be responsible for developing administrative procedures for road improvement, considering changes in the land use and density, establishing standards for the improvements, and all other activities related to the intent of the program.

**90.3 Applicability**

The fees required by this Article shall be imposed upon all development occurring after June 10,2005. These regulations shall not apply to any rezoning, conditional use permit, or subdivision application made prior to the date of the approval of these regulations by the County Commission. Development for the purpose of any activity requiring platting, replatting, or a building permit, where fees were not previously paid, shall be deemed eligible for payment. Any expansion of use by more than 25 percent over the level of the original use, shall be deemed to be an expansion of such activity, and shall require the payment of fees.

**90.4 Effect on Other Regulations**

This Article shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, the density of development, design and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or the provision of capital improvements subject to these Zoning Regulations or other regulations of Ray County, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all development.

**90.5 Improvements as Additional Requirement**

# All subdivisions filed under the Major Subdivision application are subject to a review of needed off-site improvements. If, during staff review, there are concerns, a study may be ordered to assess the actual off-site impacts of the subdivision.

# A. Off-Site Improvements

When a proposed development is projected to have off-site drainage or traffic impacts, the subdivider may be required to complete certain off-site improvements that are intended to mitigate the effects of the increased runoff or traffic counts. Such improvements will be supported by a Traffic Impact Study done by the applicant and included in the conditions of the Final Plat approval. Improvements may include, but are not limited to:

1.  Streets and thoroughfare facilities
2.  Traffic control facilities
3.  Bridges
4.  Storm drainage facilities

**3\. Off‑Street Parking Schedule “C”**

Schedule “C” uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off‑street parking standard.

a. Parking Study

Anyone proposing to develop or expand a use requiring Schedule “C” parking must submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off‑street parking spaces proposed. A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.

b. Review by Planning and Zoning Administrator

The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off‑street parking standard for the proposed use. After reviewing the parking study, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall establish a minimum off‑street parking standard for the proposed use.

c. Appeals

Appeals of the Planning and Zoning Administrator ’s decision may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.14

**C. Rules for Computing Requirements**

The following rules apply when computing off‑street parking and loading requirements.

**1\. Multiple Uses**

Lots containing more than 1 use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.

**2\. Fractions**

When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of ½ or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than ½ will be rounded up to the next higher whole number.

**3\. Area Measurements**

Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-footage‑based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area, which for purposes of computing off‑street parking requirements, shall mean the gross floor area of the building measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings and shall include the following areas:

a. the area of each floor of the structure and

b. all attic space having headroom of 7 feet-10 inches or more

4\. **Occupancy‑Based Standards**

For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire‑rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.

**5\. Unlisted Uses**

Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off‑street parking schedule, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall apply the off‑street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with Off-Street Parking Schedule “C.”

**D. Location of Required Parking**

**1\. On-Site Parking; Setbacks and Buffering**

Except as expressly stated in this Article, all required off‑street parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use. Unless otherwise expressly stated, off-street parking areas shall be set back at least 10 feet from all front (street right-of-way) and rear property lines.

a. Street Buffers

Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent street rights-of-way by principal buildings or by landscape buffer strips as follows:

| Parking Area Size Number of Spaces | Buffer Width Minimum (feet) | Minimum Planting Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5-15 | 5 | Hedgerow (shrubs planted maximum of 3 feet on center) |
| 16-50 | 10 | 1 small tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet |
| 51+ | 20 | 1 medium tree + 8 shrubs per 25 linear feet |

Minimum sizes: shrubs = 1 gallon, small deciduous tree = 1½-inch DBH, small evergreen tree = 4½-foot height, medium deciduous tree = 2½-inch DBH, medium evergreen tree = 5½ feet height (DBH=Diameter at Breast Height)

The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit the use of existing (pre-development) vegetation as a substitute

for landscape buffer strips if such existing vegetation will provide a visual buffer

b. Residential Buffers

Off-street parking areas containing more than 5 parking spaces shall be screened from view of adjacent residential zoning districts by buildings, fences, walls or dense landscape planting screens with a minimum height of 5 feet. Preservation of existing (pre-development) vegetation is the preferred method of screening.

**2\. Off‑Site Parking‑**

Off‑street parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if approved in accordance with Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the off‑site parking complies with the all of following standards.

a. Ineligible Activities

Off‑site parking may not be used to satisfy the off‑street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience‑oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located off‑site.

1.  Location

No off‑site parking space may be located more than 1,000 feet from the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area. Off‑site parking spaces may not be separated from the use that it serves by a street right‑of‑way with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade‑sep­arated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area.

c. Zoning Classification

Off‑site parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts. Off‑site parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or nonresidential zoning districts.

d. Agreement for Off‑Site Parking

In the event that an off‑site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement will be required. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning and Zoning Department. Recordation of the agreement with the Recorder of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off‑site parking area. An off‑site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off‑street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this Article.

**3\. Shared Parking**

Developments or uses with different operating hours or peak business periods may share off‑street parking spaces if approved in accordance with the Conditional Use Permit procedures of Article 30.9 and if the shared parking complies with the all of following standards.

a. Location

Shared parking spaces must be located within 1000 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.

b. Zoning Classification

Shared parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts. Shared parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or nonresidential zoning districts.

c. Shared Parking Study

Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off‑street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the Planning and Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be provided in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off‑street parking spaces.

d. Agreement for Shared Parking

A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning and Zoning Department. Recordation of the agreement with the Recorder of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off‑site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off‑street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this Article.

**E. Accessible Parking for Physically Disabled Persons**

A portion of the total number of required off-street parking spaces in each off-street parking area shall be specifically designated, located and reserved for use by persons with physical disabilities.

**1\. Number of Spaces**

The minimum number of accessible spaces to be provided shall be a portion of the total number of off-street parking spaces required, as determined from the following schedule. Parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall be counted toward fulfilling off-street parking standards.

| Total Parking Spaces Provided | Minimum Number of Accessible Spaces | Minimum Number of Van-Accessible Spaces | Minimum Number of Car-Accessible Spaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-25 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

**100.2 Number of Uses/Structures per Lot**

A. Only one principal structure (residence) may be constructed on agriculturally or Residentially zoned property. Accessory buildings and uses must comply with the corresponding zoning district.

B. A lot may be used for more than 1 principal nonresidential **use** and more than 1 principal nonresidential **structure**, provided that all structures are separated by a minimum distance of 15 feet and provided that development on the lot complies with the proper zoning district and all applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations.

**100.3 Traffic Impact Studies**

**A. Applicability**

A traffic impact study may be required with Zoning District Map amendment applications, preliminary plats or planned unit developments that are projected to generate 100 or more peak hour vehicle trips or when the County Commission determines that the proposed development will have a measurable impact on the county road system.

**B. Study Scope**

When a traffic impact study is required, the type and scope of the study shall be determined during a meeting with the County Commission. The County Commission may also involve representatives of or request assessments from other agencies and departments. The elements to be determined during the meeting shall include:

**1\. Type of Study**

The possible types of reports include: a letter report, full traffic impact analysis report or special report (e.g., sight distance survey).

**2\. Definition of Impact Area**

The points of access and key streets and intersections that may be affected by development of the subject tract constitute the Impact Area. Traffic recorder and turning movement assessment locations shall be determined.

**3\. Period of Analysis**

Periods of analysis may include: daily traffic, AM, PM or weekend peak hour.

**4\. Analysis Scenarios**

Scenarios for analysis include: existing conditions, opening year conditions with and without development, and 10 years after opening with and without development.

**5\. Process**

Process for determining trip generation and distribution including: trip generation category, diversion assumptions and distribution assumptions.

**6\. Growth Rate Assumption**

The rate of growth assumed in background traffic assumptions.

**100.3 Traffic Impact Studies**

**Article 110 Environmental**

**110.1 Dams and Water Impoundment Structures**

**A. General**

Dams and water impoundment structures shall be planned, designed and constructed under the supervision of a structural or professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri and shall comply with all applicable county and state standards. A preliminary engineering report, including soil investigations and design procedures, in accordance with state and county standards, may be submitted to the county prior to any development approval. The applicant's engineer shall certify that the dam is constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. (See Article 80.13)

**B. Dams**

A dam construction permit must be obtained from the Building Official before beginning construction of any dam. A dam construction permit shall only be granted as follows:

1\. Dams that are proposed to be constructed on parcels of less than 20 acres in area shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri. Prior to construction of such dam, detailed design plans shall be submitted for review by the Building Official for compliance with all applicable county and state standards. After the construction of such dam, the engineer shall certify that the dam is built in accordance with the approved plans.

2\. Submitted plans must show the method of dam construction, the materials to be used for fill, including the specified soil types, all proposed structures for the control of excess water, and the maximum land area that the impounded water could cover. The plan shall note the number of acres contained in the drainage area topographically higher than the lowest point of the dam.

3\. Dams that impound water from a drainage area of 20 acres or more shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri. Prior to construction of such, detailed design plans and specifications shall be submitted to the County Engineer for design review and compliance with State of Missouri standards. The professional engineer shall certify that the dam has been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications and State of Missouri standards.

4\. No pond or lake shall be located closer than 50 feet to any county, state or city road, street or road right‑of‑way.

5\. No pond or lake shall impound water over a utility easement, except a drainage easement, or over an existing utility line including sewage lateral fields. Where impounded waters will back up on to other (off-site) property, water impoundment easements shall be required and recorded.

6\. Ponds or lakes with a surface area of 1 acre or less (at normal pool level or normal spillway elevation) and used exclusively for an individual dwelling unit’s sewage retention or for agricultural purposes shall be exempt from the standards of this Article.

**C. Retention Basins**

When the development of a site will substantially increase the runoff of stormwater onto adjoining properties, the County Engineer may require that retention basins be provided on‑site to control the rate of runoff.

**D. Dam Breach Studies**

Decision-making bodies shall be authorized to require the preparation of a dam breach study for lakes with an area of 5 acres or more (at normal spillway elevation). When required, breach studies shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri.

As in the case of FIRM floodplain mapping, development shall be discouraged within the designated dam breach area.

**110.2 Stormwater Management**

Stormwater is water from rain or melting snow that does not soak into the ground. It flows from rooftops, over paved areas and bare soil, and through sloped lawns. As it flows, this runoff collects and transports soil, manure, salt, pesticides, fertilizer, oil and grease, leaves, litter and other potential pollutants. Contaminants include: livestock waste, fuels and solvents, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers. Contrary to popular belief, most storm sewers do not carry storm water to wastewater treatment plants. Stormwater is unavoidable, but keeping harmful chemicals and materials out of runoff, as well as designing detention areas that would reduce the flows and, therefore, the amount of erosion can reduce its effects.

Soil type can affect surface water contamination. Although runoff occurs from all soil types, clay soils are more likely to cause surface water runoff because they are less permeable. Eroding soil is considered a water pollutant.

For additional information, contact the University of Missouri Extension Service, the Ray County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Conservation, and the Ray County Health Department.

**A. Practices that will reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality in streams**

1\. Cover bare soil with vegetable and flower gardens, grass seed, and natural prairie

grass coverings.

2\. Remove all debris from ditches and creeks and from areas where they might be

swept into a channel.

3\. Consider using materials other than concrete or asphalt for drives and walkways

that would allow for more seepage into the ground.

4\. Keep basement windows or doors sealed against leaks.

5\. Slope the yard away from the foundation to prevent water from pooling near the

structure.

6\. Use downspouts to carry water from the roof onto grassy areas.

7\. Consider a landscaping layout engineered to reduce runoff.

8\. Pump and repair on-site septic systems on a regular basis.

9\. Replace septic systems if it is more than 30 years old, made of soil or

undersized for any additions you have made to your house.

10\. Do not drive vehicles on the drain field.

11\. Do not pave, build, or pile heavy objects on a drain field.

12\. Divert roof runoff and other surface runoff away from the drain field.

13\. Do not dispose of tissues, diapers, sanitary napkins, cigarette butts and other

solid waste down the toilet.

14\. Paints, solvents, acids, drain cleaners, oils and pesticides can pass untreated

through your system and contaminate the groundwater.

15\. Consider the individual characteristics of the site when building; such as soil

type and depth; depth to bedrock; depth to the water table; and location of

wetlands, streams, or other surface water.

These Zoning Regulations may require all development of more than 20 acres to submit a stormwater plan for review.

**_Active Channel –_** _The area of the stream channel that is subject to frequent flows (approximately once per one and a half years), and that includes the portion of the channel below where the floodplain flattens._

## B. Stream Protection

**110.6 Floodplain Management**

**A. Floodplain Designations**

1\. The special flood hazard areas of unincorporated Ray County are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

2\. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

**B. Statutory Authority**

The regulations of this Article are adopted pursuant to the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the State of Missouri, including the statutory authority conferred by RSMo 49.600.

![Diagram 14](images/diagram_14.png)

**C. Purpose**

It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

1\. restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

2\. require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3\. control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;

4\. control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage waters;

5\. prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands; and

6\. maintain the county’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d).

**D. Objectives**

The objectives of the regulations of this Article are:

1\. to protect human life and health;

2\. to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3\. to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4\. to minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5\. to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;

6\. to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;

7\. to protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard; and

8\. to assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the county to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.

**E. Applicability**

The regulations of this Article shall apply to all areas of unincorporated Ray County identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones, AE, AO, and AH Zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map dated January 19, 1983 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Article, no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a Floodplain Development Permit granted in accordance with the procedures and standards of this Article.

**F. Basis For Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard**

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management agency in its Flood Insurance Study, dated January 19, 1983 with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Article.

**G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability**

The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger

floods can and will occur on rare occasions, and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The regulations of this Article do not imply that land outside special flood hazard areas or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of the Ray County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

**H. Interpretation**

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.

**I. Compliance**

No development located within known flood hazard areas of unincorporated Ray County shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.

**J. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions**

This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Article imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this Article shall prevail.

**110.7 Floodplain Definitions**

**A. Procedure**

Variances from the regulations and standards of this Article may be requested and granted in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.8, as modified by the provisions of this Article.

**B. Variance Criteria**

In passing upon applications for variances from the provisions of this Article, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other Articles of this Article, and the following criteria:

1\. The danger to life and property due to flood damage.

2\. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.

3\. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.

4\. The importance of services provided by the proposed facility to the community.

5\. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.

6\. The availability of alternate locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed

use.

waters, if applicable, expected at the site.

11\. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,

including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges.

**C. Conditions for Approval of Variances**

Generally, Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of ½ acre or less in area contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the conditions of paragraphs 1 through 5 of this sub-Article (immediately below) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond ½ acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

1\. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Article.

2\. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

3\. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

4\. Variances shall only be issued upon:

a. a showing of good and sufficient cause;

b. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

c. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

5\. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice (over the signature of the Presiding Commissioner of the County Commission) that the cost of flood insurance will increase to as high as $25 per $100 of coverage and that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions.

**110.16 Floodplain Nonconformities**

A structure or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful at the time of establishment but that does not comply with the provisions of this Article may be continued, subject to the following conditions:

**A. Discontinuance and Abandonment**

A nonconformity under this Article that is discontinued or remains vacant for a continuous period of 12 months, shall be presumed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure or land site must conform with all applicable provisions of this Article. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon a showing, to the satisfaction of the Floodplain Administrator that during such period, the owner of the land or structure has been:

1\. maintaining the land and structure in accordance with all applicable regulations, including the Building Code and did not intend to discontinue the use; or

2\. has been actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for sale or lease; or

3\. has been engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there was not an intent to abandon.

**B. Nuisances**

Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconformity.

**C. Damage or Destruction**

If any nonconformity is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is reconstructed in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Article. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

**110.17 Floodplain Violations**

Violation of the provisions of this floodplain ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Ray County or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

**110.18 Floodplain Amendments**

The regulations, restrictions and boundaries set forth in this Article may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. All such amendments shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of Article 30.2. A copy of amendments approved will be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

**120.3 Computations and Measurements**

![Diagram 15](images/diagram_15.png)

**A. Sign Area of Individual Signs**

The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) is computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral Article of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such supporting device otherwise meets the regulations of these Zoning Regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.

**B. Area of Double‑Faced Signs**

![Diagram 16](images/diagram_16.png)

Where the sign faces of a double‑faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 90 degrees or less, only 1 display face shall be counted in computing sign area. If the 2 faces of a double‑faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the larger sign face shall be counted as the sign’s area. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multi‑faced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign.

**C. Height**

The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to the highest point of the sign or sign structure, measured from the elevation of the road to which it is oriented, or, if there is no road, from the finished grade elevation beneath the sign.

**D. Wall Area**

In computing the area of a wall only the first 12 feet of building height shall be used.

**E. Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Lot**

The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a lot shall be computed by applying the formula set out in Table 120‑2, (Maximum Total Sign Area), to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as specified in the table. Lots fronting on 2 or more streets shall be allowed the stated sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.

**A. Purpose**

The regulations of this Article govern uses, structures, lots and other situations that came into existence legally but that do not conform to one or more requirements of these Zoning Regulations. It is the general policy of the county to allow uses, struc­tures or lots that came into existence legally and in conformance with then-applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable re­quirements of these Zoning Regulations to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such use into compliance with the current Zoning Regulations as is reasonably possible, all subject to the regulations of this Article. The regulations of this Article are intended to recognize the interests of the proper­ty owner in continuing to use property but to control the expansion of nonconformity, prohibit re-establishment of abandoned nonconformity and limit re-establishment of nonconforming structures that have been substantially destroyed.

**B. Authority to Continue**

Any nonconformity that legally existed on June 1, 2005 or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to these Zoning Regulations may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

**C. Determination of Nonconformity Status**

The burden of establishing that a nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases be solely upon the owner of such nonconformity.

**D. Repairs and Maintenance**

Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformity shall be permitted unless such repairs are otherwise expressly prohibited by these Zoning Regulations. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official.

**E.** **Change of Tenancy or Ownership**

The status of a nonconformity is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.

A nonconforming use is a use that was legally established but which is no longer allowed by the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

**B. Expansion**

A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless one of the following conditions exists:

1\. such expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconforming aspects of the situation

1.  the expansion is into a part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and

manifestly designed or arranged for such use; or

3\. the expansion is for a living space addition to a house.

4\. Expansion for the sole purpose of providing off-street parking shall not be considered expansion of a nonconforming use.

**C.** **Change of Use**

A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.

**D. Loss of Legal Nonconformity Status**

1.  **Abandonment**

If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 days, the use shall be considered abandoned. Once abandoned, the use’s legal nonconforming status shall be lost and re‑establishment of the use shall be prohibited. Any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

1.  **Damage or Destruction**

If a nonconforming use or a structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the nonconforming use shall not be restored unless in full compliance with the provisions of these Zoning Regulations.

If a nonconforming use or structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged by less than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the use may be re-established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, provided that such repairs, restoration or reconstruction are substantially completed within 12 months of the date of such damage.

1.  **Accessory Uses and Structures**

No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it complies with all regulations of these Zoning Regulations.

**130.3 Nonconforming Structures**

**A. Definition**

A nonconforming structure is any building or structure that was legally established but which no longer complies with the Density, Intensity and Dimensional Standards of Article 70.

**B.** **Use**

A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the underlying zoning district.

# C. Expansion

A nonconforming structure may be enlarged or expanded if the expansion does not increase the extent of nonconformity, e.g. setbacks, lot coverage, use.

**D.** **Moving**

A nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or in part to another location if the movement or relocation does not increase the extent of nonconformity.

**E.** **Loss of Legal Nonconforming Status; Damage or Destruction**

If a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the nonconforming structure shall not be restored unless in compliance with the provisions of these Zoning Regulations. If a nonconforming structure is damaged by less than 50 percent of its value immediately prior to damage, the structure may be re-established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, provided that such repairs, restoration or reconstruction are substantially completed within 12 months of the date of such damage.
