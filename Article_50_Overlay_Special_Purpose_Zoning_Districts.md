# Article 50 - Overlay and Special Purpose Zoning Districts

## 50.1 Overlay and Special Purpose Zoning Districts Established
The following Overlay and Special Purpose zoning districts are hereby established:

- **PUD** - Planned Unit Development District
- **Open Space and Parks Master Plan Overlay**

## 50.2 PUD - Planned Unit Development District

### A. Description
The PUD, Planned Unit Development district is an overlay zoning district that permits greater flexibility of land planning and site design than conventional zoning districts. Its intended use is for large scale design-oriented developments, commercial, industrial and mixed-use developments. The PUD regulations:

1. Encourage the conservation of natural features
2. Provide for efficient use of public services and improvements
3. Encourage and preserve opportunities for energy efficient development

### B. Applicability
A PUD district may be approved only when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the County Commission that a proposed PUD project would result in a greater benefit to the county than would development under conventional zoning district regulations.

### C. Developer's Statement of Intent
Each PUD Concept Plan application shall contain a statement from the applicant describing how the proposed development departs from the otherwise applicable standards of this Land Development Code and how the proposed development, on balance, is an improvement over what would be required under otherwise applicable standards.

### D. Review and Approval Procedures
PUDs shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of [Article 30.8](#article-30-development-review-procedures).

### E. Effect of Other Zoning District Standards
Except as expressly authorized by the regulations of this Article and approved as part of a PUD plan, all of the standards of these Zoning Regulations apply to development within a PUD. Otherwise applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations may be modified by the County Commission as part of its approval of a PUD if such modifications are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and if the development is found to be an improvement over what would be required under otherwise applicable standards.

### F. Use Regulations
The County Commission shall determine the types of uses allowed within a PUD at the time of Concept Plan approval. Only uses that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan may be allowed within a PUD.

### G. Development Intensity
The total number of dwelling units and level of nonresidential development allowed within a PUD shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and not exceed the level that can be adequately served by public facilities. To evaluate the capacity of streets and other facilities serving a PUD, the Planning and Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to conduct a traffic impact study or other infrastructure capacity analysis to provide information on the development's expected impacts on existing and planned facilities.

### H. Roadway Access
Unless otherwise expressly approved during the PUD approval process, principal vehicular access to PUDs must be from collector and higher classification streets. Any PUD containing over 50 dwelling units or 30,000 square feet of nonresidential floor space must provide at least 2 access points, wherever possible.

### I. Open Space
[*Open space requirements for PUDs*]

### J. Preservation of Natural Features
Mature trees, vegetative cover, watercourses and other natural site features must be preserved to the maximum extent feasible.

### K. Additional Conditions
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend and the County Commission shall impose such other conditions as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of these Zoning Regulations such as a Drainage and Stormwater Plan, shared sewage treatment facility plans and approvals from the PSC, and Construction Plans. Such conditions and/or plans shall be submitted 4 weeks prior to the next scheduled public hearing and reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Department and the Highway Department.

## 50.3 Open Space and Parks Master Plan Overlay

### A. Purpose

The overall goal is to provide connections between historical sites, connections between neighborhoods, and provide ample open space for recreation.

### B. Parks Master Plan
