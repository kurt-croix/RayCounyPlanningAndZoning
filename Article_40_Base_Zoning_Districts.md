# Article 40 - Base Zoning Districts

## 40.1 Establishment of Base Zoning Districts

The following base zoning districts are hereby established:

**Figure 40.1 - Base Zoning Districts**

| District | District Name | Type | Development Zone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-A | Agricultural District | Agricultural | Rural Low Density |
| R-1 | Residential Rural District | Residential | Rural Low Density |
| R-1A | Residential Low Density District | Residential | Low Density |
| R-1B | Residential Urban District | Residential | Urban Density |
| R-2 | Residential Duplex District | Residential | Urban Density |
| R-3 | Residential Multi-Unit District | Residential | Urban Density |
| R-MHP | Mobile Home Park | Residential | Urban Density |
| S & O | Service and Office District | Commercial | All |
| B-1 | Community Business District | Commercial | Urban Density |
| B-2 | General Business District | Commercial | Urban Density |
| I-1 | Limited Industrial District | Industrial | All |
| I-2 | General Industrial District | Industrial | All |
| PUD | Planned Unit Development | Mixed-Use | All |
| OP | Open Space/Park/Public Uses | Public | All |

The [zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) hierarchy is generally based on development intensity, not [use](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use). Under this system, the R-A district is listed as the most restrictive (also referred to as least intensive) because it allows the lowest density development (1 [dwelling unit](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) per 19 acres).

## 40.2 Zoning District Hierarchy

References in these Zoning Regulations to less restrictive or more restrictive [zoning districts](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) are references to the "intensity" of development allowed, not necessarily the range of [uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) permitted. Under the hierarchy established by these Zoning Regulations, the R-A district is the most restrictive base-[zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district), while the I-2 district is the least restrictive base-[zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district). Overlay and Special Purpose [zoning districts](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) are not included in the [zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) hierarchy.

## 40.3 R-A Agricultural District

### A. Description
The [agricultural](./Article_150_Definitions.md#agriculture) district (R-A) is primarily intended to help retain large tracts of land for [agricultural](./Article_150_Definitions.md#agriculture) and open space purposes and to minimize conflicts between [agricultural](./Article_150_Definitions.md#agriculture) [uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) and adjacent development. It is possible that parts of this district will change to more intense urban [zoning districts](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) as utility services are extended. Minimum [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) area in R-A zoning shall be 19 acres, and shall have one single [family](./Article_150_Definitions.md#family) residence.

### B. Use Regulations
The following table shows which [uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) are allowed in the R-A district. For a summary of [uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use) allowed in all [zoning districts](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district), see [Article 60.1](./Article_60_Use_Regulations.md#601-use-table). 
- P = Permitted by-right
- C = Allowed only if reviewed and approved as a Conditional Use (See [Article 30.9](Article_30_Development_Review_Procedures.md#309-conditional-use-permits))
