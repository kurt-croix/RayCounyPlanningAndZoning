## 40.1 Establishment of Base Zoning Districts

The following base zoning districts are hereby established:

**Figure 40.1 - Base Zoning Districts**

| District | District Name | Type | Development Zone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-A | Agricultural District | Agricultural | Rural Low Density |
| R-1 | Residential Rural District | Residential | Rural Low Density |
| R-1A | Residential Low Density District | Residential | Low Density |

## 40.2 Zoning District Hierarchy

References in these Zoning Regulations to less restrictive or more restrictive zoning districts are references to the "intensity" of development allowed, not necessarily the range of uses permitted. Under the hierarchy established by these Zoning Regulations, the R-A district is the most restrictive base-zoning district, while the I-2 district is the least restrictive base-zoning district. Overlay and Special Purpose zoning districts are not included in the zoning district hierarchy.

*Note: The zoning district hierarchy is generally based on development intensity, not use. Under this system, the R-A district is listed as the most restrictive (also referred to as least intensive) because it allows the lowest density development (1 dwelling unit per 19 acres).*

## 40.3 R-A Agricultural District

### A. Description
The agricultural district (R-A) is primarily intended to help retain large tracts of land for agricultural and open space purposes and to minimize conflicts between agricultural uses and adjacent development. It is possible that parts of this district will change to more intense urban zoning districts as utility services are extended. Minimum lot area in R-A zoning shall be 19 acres, and shall have one single family residence.

### B. Use Regulations
The following table shows which uses are allowed in the R-A district. For a summary of uses allowed in all zoning districts, see [Article 60.1](Article_60_Use_Regulations.md#601-use-table). 
- P = Permitted by-right
- C = Allowed only if reviewed and approved as a Conditional Use (See [Article 30.9](Article_30_Development_Review_Procedures.md#309-conditional-use-permits))
