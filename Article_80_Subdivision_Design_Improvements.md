# Article 80 - Subdivision Design and Improvements

## 80.1 General

This Article establishes standards for the design and construction of [subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) to ensure adequate [infrastructure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#infrastructure), public safety, and compatibility with the county's development goals.

## 80.2 Layout and Design

### A. Compliance with Plans and Regulations
The design of subdivisions shall be consistent with:

1. The [Comprehensive Plan](./Article_150_Definitions.md#comprehensive-plan) and all other adopted plans and policies of the [County Commission](./Article_150_Definitions.md#county-commission); and
2. The requirements of the [zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) in which the [property](./Article_150_Definitions.md#property) is located and all other applicable standards of these Zoning Regulations.

### B. Traffic Movement and Pedestrian Circulation

1. The design of [subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) should create an integrated system of [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot), [streets](./Article_150_Definitions.md#street), trails, and [infrastructure](./Article_150_Definitions.md#infrastructure) that provides for efficient movement of people, bicycles, and automobiles within the subdivision and to and from adjacent development.

2. All [subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) should provide for the efficient movement of through traffic by providing a completely interconnected hierarchy of [streets](./Article_150_Definitions.md#street) in order to avoid isolation of [residential areas](./Article_150_Definitions.md#residential) and over-reliance on [arterial streets](./Article_150_Definitions.md#arterial-street).

3. [Subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) should be designed to provide safe and attractive pedestrian routes to nearby [commercial](./Article_150_Definitions.md#commercial) centers, employment, [recreation](./Article_150_Definitions.md#recreation), and other [uses](./Article_150_Definitions.md#use).

4. Street layouts should be uncomplicated, so that emergency services, public services, and visitors can find their way to their destinations.

5. The proliferation of individual [driveways](./Article_150_Definitions.md#driveway) on state and county roads should be avoided. Homeowners are responsible for all maintenance of [driveway easements](./Article_150_Definitions.md#easement). Specific address signage may be required.

6. [Residential subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#residential-subdivision) involving 5 or more [lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) should be served by internal [street](./Article_150_Definitions.md#street) systems rather than relying on the state and county roads for direct access to all lots, unless exempted by the Ray County Road and Bridge or the state regulating authority. If the [decision-making body](./Article_150_Definitions.md#decision-making-body) allows direct residential driveway access to state or county roads, the decision-making body shall be authorized to require shared access drives and other mitigation measures to reduce the number of access points on to state and county roads and thereby promote public safety and efficient movement of traffic.

### C. Streetscape Appearance

1. Lot and street designs should be designed to avoid extended distances of back yard frontage on arterial streets, and where that cannot be avoided, buffering of back yards from those streets should be landscaped with buffers and fences.

2. Edges of subdivisions should include adequate landscaping and buffering to improve the image of the area, and to protect future residents of the subdivision and adjacent developments from adverse impacts caused by significant differences in use, development intensity, or development height.

3. [Lots](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) and [streets](./Article_150_Definitions.md#street) should not be designed to require significant numbers of adjacent [dwelling units](./Article_150_Definitions.md#dwelling-unit) with front-loaded garages that dominate the streetscape.

### D. Open Spaces

1. [Open spaces](./Article_150_Definitions.md#open-space) should be integrated into and throughout the [subdivision](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision), should be connected with each other and with open spaces in adjacent development.

2. [Open spaces](./Article_150_Definitions.md#open-space) anticipated for use as active or developed [parks](./Article_150_Definitions.md#park) should be located on relatively flat, well-drained terrain.

3. Open spaces not anticipated for use as active or developed parks should be located on prominent high points with significant views, or along significant and interesting geological features or wooded areas, or along significant drainage.

4. [Subdivisions](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) should be designed and laid out in a manner that creates the least damage to the natural environment, avoids to the maximum extent feasible, significant natural resources such as prime [agricultural lands](./Article_150_Definitions.md#agricultural), wooded areas and [wetlands](./Article_150_Definitions.md#wetlands).

### E. Specifications and Standards Generally

1. All [public improvements](./Article_150_Definitions.md#public-improvements) shall be constructed in compliance with the standards and specifications established by this Article, the County Code and adopted regulations, including all design standards and requirements set forth.

2. No [subdivider](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivider) shall be relieved of the duty to construct [public improvements](./Article_150_Definitions.md#public-improvements) for the [subdivision](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) until all public improvements are constructed, approved and accepted by the county. This may be accomplished by an irrevocable letter of credit, cash escrow, performance bond, or other financial improvement guarantee acceptable to the County.

## 80.4 Lots

### A. Width to Depth Ratio
The width to depth ratio of any [lot](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot) shall not exceed 1 to 4 (width to depth).

### B. Lot Area
Minimum [lot area](./Article_150_Definitions.md#lot-area) shall be subject to the underlying [zoning district](./Article_150_Definitions.md#zoning-district) in which the [subdivision](./Article_150_Definitions.md#subdivision) is located, unless modified by [Planned Unit Development](./Article_150_Definitions.md#planned-unit-development).

### C. Land Remnants
Remnants of land containing less area than prescribed by the underlying zoning district regulations shall not be permitted unless designated and accepted for utility or public purposes.

Sidewalks shall be constructed in the road right-of-way within 1 foot from the property line. Sidewalks shall also be installed in any pedestrian easements as may be required by the decision-making body.

### B. Paving Width and Depth
Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the Technical Specifications and Design Criteria Manual, unless different design criteria are approved by the County Commission (e.g. trails instead of sidewalks).

### C. Responsibility for Installation
Construction of sidewalks along streets shall be the responsibility of the builder on each lot adjacent to the street. Sidewalks in common open spaces, greenways or parks shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.

### D. Maintenance
The maintenance of sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the adjacent property owner or homeowners association and shall not be the responsibility of the County.

## 80.7 Vehicular Circulation (Streets and Bridges)

All new public street and bridge construction shall comply with all applicable state and county requirements. It is furthermore intended that all streets be dedicated, along with required rights-of-way, to the county. The standards of this Article shall apply to any street or bridge regardless of location in a Rural Density, Low Density or Urban Density Development Zone, unless otherwise expressly stated. In the Urban Density Development Zone, compliance with more restrictive standards of the nearest municipality may be required if such property lies within the Stated Annexation Intent Area of the subject municipality.

### A. Street Curvature
On streets with reverse curves, a reasonable tangent shall be provided between curves to permit a smooth flow of traffic.

### B. Street Layout
Proposed streets shall conform to topography as nearly as possible to reduce drainage problems and grades. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade. Except in unusual circumstances (as determined by the County Highway Department), in hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than 2 percent rate for a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground, and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance within the right-of-way. Sight triangles shall conform to the requirements of [Article 100.4](./Article_100_Development_Standards.md#1004-sight-triangles). The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersection, shall be 3 percent or less.

- *Length shall be measured from the centerline of an intersection of a cross street to the center of the cul-de-sac.

### H. Offset
Local streets shall be at least 150 feet apart (measured centerline to centerline).

### I. Right-Angle Intersections
Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right-angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be 60 degrees.

### J. Existing Half Streets
Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted and dedicated.

### K. Streets Adjacent to a Railroad, Freeway, Principal Highway or Arterial Street
Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad right-of-way, limited access freeways, or principal highways or arterial streets, the decision-making body may require a marginal access street or frontage road adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way in order to ensure traffic safety and maintain adopted levels of service on the adjacent street. The distance from said right-of-way shall be determined based on a consideration of minimum distance requirements for approach connections to future grade-separated intersections.

### L. Street Design Requirements
Unless otherwise specified herein, the minimum design criteria, construction methods and material specifications for public improvements required by the Article shall conform to any specification as to procedure, equipment, or materials not covered in the street specifications and standards APWA, and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto, or the Ray County Highway Department's special instructions, shall be subject to the [Missouri Department of Transportation](https://www.modot.org/) (MoDOT) Standards for Highway Construction, 2004 Edition and subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto, for all Ray County roads in the unincorporated area.
